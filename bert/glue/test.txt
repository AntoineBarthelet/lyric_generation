1	7000	16704	Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,	My woman needs it every day,
1	7001	16705	She promised this alad she'd stay,	She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
1	7002	16706	She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,	Now she's opened up a lefty home,
1	7003	16707	She's proud, but she needs to roam,	She's opened up a happy home,
1	7004	16708	She [incomprehensible]	And the Santa Fe.
1	7005	16709	Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,	Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
1	7006	16710	I'm never, never far from home,	I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
1	7007	16711	Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,	She's the worst you could ever have,
1	7008	16712	Since the madman, ahe's so glad,	She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
1	7009	16713	She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.	Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
1	7010	16714	My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],	I won't have my nature way,
1	7011	16715	And I'm leaving every day to run away	From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
1	7012	16716	My woman's never sitting at home,	She's packing up a lease unknown,
1	7013	16717	She's crying like an evil stone,	She leave by the other and roam,
1	7014	16718	But she ain't gonna find the road	And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
0	7015	16719	Ready, George?	If not for you,
1	7016	16720	Babe, I couldn't find the door,	Couldn't even see the floor,
0	7017	16721	I'd be sad and blue,	If not for you.
1	7018	16722	If not for you,	The night would see me wide awake,
1	7019	16723	The day would surely have to break,	But it would not be new,
1	7020	16724	If not for you.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
1	7021	16725	Rain would gather too.	Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
0	7022	16726	I'd be lost if not for you.	If not for you,
1	7023	16727	The winter would hold no spring,	I couldn't hear the robin sing,
1	7024	16728	I just wouldn't have a clue,	If not for you.
1	7025	16729	Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?	I'm sad and lonely too.
1	7026	16730	Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?	I'm falling in love with you.
0	7027	16731	Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing ahere,	Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
1	7028	16732	Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?	The night will soon be gone.
1	7029	16733	I have seen you standing in the smoky haze	And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
1	7030	16734	Mine alone.	Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
1	7031	16735	Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,	There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
1	7032	16736	You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,	Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
1	7033	16737	Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.	Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
1	7034	16738	Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.	There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
1	7035	16739	Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.	Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
1	7036	16740	Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child	And it never seemed strange.
1	7037	16741	Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,	I know something is changed.
1	7038	16742	I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,	Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
1	7039	16743	Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,	Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
1	7040	16744	Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,	I'm in love with you!
1	7041	16745	Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
1	7042	16746	Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
1	7043	16747	And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,	Heading out for the old East Coast  Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
1	7044	16748	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
1	7045	16749	He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.	And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
1	7046	16750	And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	And she turned around to look at him as he was awalking away,
1	7047	16751	"She said, ""This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
1	7048	16752	He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
1	7049	16753	When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,	Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
1	7050	16754	But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,	He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
1	7051	16755	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
1	7052	16756	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
1	7053	16757	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""What's your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
1	7054	16758	I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
1	7055	16759	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""Thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
1	7056	16760	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
1	7057	16761	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
1	7058	16762	Tangled up in blue.	He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
1	7059	16763	And everything that she ever planned just ahad to be postponed.	He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
1	7060	16764	With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,	And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
1	7061	16765	The only thing I knew how to do was akeep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
1	7062	16766	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
1	7063	16767	Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
1	7064	16768	But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
0	7065	16769	Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,	Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
1	7066	16770	Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.	Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
1	7067	16771	Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,	I just ain't  can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
0	7068	16772	"Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, ""Mother took a trip"","	"Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, ""Mother took a trip"","
1	7069	16773	Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.	Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
1	7070	16774	Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,	But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
0	7071	16775	Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,	Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
1	7072	16776	But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.	Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
1	7073	16777	Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,	But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
0	7074	16778	My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,	My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
1	7075	16779	Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,	Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
1	7076	16780	They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,	She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me 
1	7077	16781	I can't help it if I'm lucky.	People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
1	7078	16782	Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.	Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
1	7079	16783	I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,	Sweet lady.
1	7080	16784	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,	Going down the back roads, heading south,
1	7081	16785	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
1	7082	16786	Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,	I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
1	7083	16787	There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,	You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
1	7084	16788	After losing every battle.	I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
1	7085	16789	Hoofbeats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.	You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
1	7086	16790	One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,	Blood on your saddle.
1	7087	16791	Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,	Blowing through the curtains in your room,
1	7088	16792	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
1	7089	16793	It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,	You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just awasn't enough to change my heart.
1	7090	16794	Now everything's a little upside down  as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,	What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
1	7091	16795	You're on the bottom.	I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
1	7092	16796	The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.	The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
1	7093	16797	You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn	So quickly into autumn.
1	7094	16798	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,	From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
1	7095	16799	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
1	7096	16800	We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,	A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
1	7097	16801	Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?	In order to get in a word with you, I'd ahave to come up with some excuse,
1	7098	16802	That just struck me kinda funny.	I been doublecrossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
1	7099	16803	Ladykillers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.	You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
1	7100	16804	You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,	You won't get it for money.
1	7101	16805	Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,	Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
1	7102	16806	Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,	We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
1	7103	16807	If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,	She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
1	7104	16808	Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,	She might think that I've forgotten her  don't tell her, it isn't so.
1	7105	16809	We had a fallingout like lovers often will,	But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
1	7106	16810	And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,	She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
1	7107	16811	If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid	Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
1	7108	16812	Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,	But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
1	7109	16813	I see a lot of people as I make the rounds	And I hear her name ahere and there as I go from town to town
1	7110	16814	And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,	Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
1	7111	16815	Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,	I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
1	7112	16816	If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,	Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
1	7113	16817	Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,	I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
1	7114	16818	Eucalyptus trees hang above the street	And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
1	7115	16819	Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room	With the golden loom.
1	7116	16820	First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine	And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
1	7117	16821	I see the hungry clouds up above your face	And then the tears roll down  what a bitter taste!
1	7118	16822	You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom	With your golden loom.
1	7119	16823	I walk across the bridge in the dismal light	Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
1	7120	16824	I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail	And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
1	7121	16825	Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume	And your golden loom.
1	7122	16826	Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,	"""Strike three,"" the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down."
1	7123	16827	Catfish, milliondollarman,	Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
1	7124	16828	Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,	So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
1	7125	16829	Catfish, milliondollarman,	Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
1	7126	16830	Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,	Smoke a custommade cigar, wear an alligator boot.
1	7127	16831	Catfish, milliondollarman,	Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
1	7128	16832	"This is a somewhat new song called ""Seven Days""."	Seven days,
1	7129	16833	Seven more days she'll be coming,	I'll be waiting at the station
1	7130	16834	For her to arrive,	Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
1	7131	16835	She been gone	Ever since I been a child,
1	7132	16836	Ever since I seen her smile.	I've never forgotten her eyes,
1	7133	16837	She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.	I been good,
1	7134	16838	I been good while I been waiting,	But maybe guilty of ahesitating.
1	7135	16839	But I've been hanging on,	Seven more days and all that will be gone.
1	7136	16840	Well, there's kissing in the valley,	Thieving in the alley,
1	7137	16841	Fighting every inch of the way.	Trying to get a lead on
1	7138	16842	Somebody new to beat on	Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
1	7139	16843	Seven days,	Seven days zipping and blowing,
1	7140	16844	But then a whistle will be blowing	And she'll be coming forth,
1	7141	16845	My beautiful comrade from the north.	Well, there's afighting in the valley,
1	7142	16846	Thieving in the alley,	Fighting every inch of the way.
0	7143	16847	Trying to get a lead on	Somebody new to beat on
1	7144	16848	Where the nights are always sadder than the day.	Seven days
1	7145	16849	And I'll know the wind blows snowing	And then a whistle will be blowing,
1	7146	16850	She'll be coming forth,	My beautiful comrade from the north.
1	7147	16851	You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,	You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
1	7148	16852	You had enough of hatred,	Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
0	7149	16853	Ye shall be changed,	Ye shall be changed,
1	7150	16854	In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,	The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
1	7151	16855	And ye shall be changed.	Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
1	7152	16856	From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is ahustle,	All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
1	7153	16857	You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.	But ye shall be achanged,
1	7154	16858	Ye shall be changed,	In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
1	7155	16859	The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes	And ye shall be changed.
1	7156	16860	The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,	Deep down inside, you know, you know  need a whole new beginning.
1	7157	16861	Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,	Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
0	7158	16862	And ye shall be achanged,	Ye shall be achanged,
1	7159	16863	In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,	The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
1	7160	16864	And ye shall be achanged.	You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
1	7161	16865	Can't live for today when all you're thinking ofa is tomorrow.	The path you've endured has been rough,
1	7162	16866	When you've decided that you've had enough,	Ye shall be achanged,
1	7163	16867	Ye shall be achanged,	In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
1	7164	16868	The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes	And ye shall be changed.
1	7165	16869	In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,	When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
1	7166	16870	There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,	Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
1	7167	16871	Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,	Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
1	7168	16872	In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand	In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
1	7169	16873	Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,	Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
1	7170	16874	The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,	To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
1	7171	16875	I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame	And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
1	7172	16876	Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand	That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
1	7173	16877	I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,	In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
1	7174	16878	In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,	In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
1	7175	16879	I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,	Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
1	7176	16880	I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan	Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
1	7177	16881	I was listening to the voices of death on parade	Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
1	7178	16882	Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,	Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
1	7179	16883	But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
1	7180	16884	Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,	They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
1	7181	16885	You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,	They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
1	7182	16886	But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
1	7183	16887	Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,	I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
1	7184	16888	The call of the wild is forever at my door,	Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
1	7185	16889	But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,	From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
1	7186	16890	Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,	I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
1	7187	16891	It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,	Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
1	7188	16892	But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
1	7189	16893	You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.	Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
1	7190	16894	Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,	In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
1	7191	16895	But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
1	7192	16896	There was someone in my body that I could hardly see	Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
1	7193	16897	Holding me back, not letting me stand,	Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
1	7194	16898	But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
1	7195	16899	My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,	Heartfixer, mindregulator, true to the end.
1	7196	16900	My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,	Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
1	7197	16901	But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,	You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
1	7198	16902	Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,	I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
1	7199	16903	Searching for the truth the way God designed it,	Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
1	7200	16904	Well, I need a woman, alright!	Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
1	7201	16905	To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,	And I want you to be that woman every time.
1	7202	16906	I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,	Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
1	7203	16907	Telltale heart will show itself to anybody near,	There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
1	7204	16908	Well, I need a woman to take my own,	I need a woman that's mine alone.
0	7205	16909	Seen you in the doorway, I seen you in the park,	Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
1	7206	16910	And I want you to be that woman.	You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
1	7207	16911	You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.	That which is not permanent don't last.
1	7208	16912	Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.	Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
1	7209	16913	Need a woman [incomprehensible],	Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
1	7210	16914	Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,	And I want you to be that woman.
1	7211	16915	Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,	Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
1	7212	16916	Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?	To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
1	7213	16917	But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,	Need a woman all the time,
1	7214	16918	To see the promised land with me as the time go by,	To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
1	7215	16919	And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,	Need that woman straight and true.
1	7216	16920	Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,	My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
1	7217	16921	Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.	Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
1	7218	16922	I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,	But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
0	7219	16923	Oh, Angelina,	Oh, Angelina.
1	7220	16924	His eyes were two slits  make any snake proud,	With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
1	7221	16925	Worshiping a god with the body of a woman wellendowed and the head of a hyena.	Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
1	7222	16926	If you can read my mind, why must I speak?	No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
0	7223	16927	Oh, Angelina,	Oh, Angelina.
1	7224	16928	In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,	The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
1	7225	16929	I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.	When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
1	7226	16930	I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,	Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
0	7227	16931	Oh, Angelina,	Oh, Angelina.
1	7228	16932	There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,	Your servants are halfdead, you're down to the bone.
1	7229	16933	Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?	She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
1	7230	16934	Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.	He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
0	7231	16935	Oh, Angelina,	Oh, Angelina.
1	7232	16936	I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,	I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
1	7233	16937	In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.	Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
1	7234	16938	Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,	Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
0	7235	16939	Oh, Angelina,	Oh, Angelina,
1	7236	16940	They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,	I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
1	7237	16941	Everything looks a little far away to me.	Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
1	7238	16942	Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,	Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
1	7239	16943	Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,	There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
0	7240	16944	Someone got a hold of my heart,	Someone got a hold of my heart,
1	7241	16945	Someone got a hold of my heart,	You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
1	7242	16946	Just got back from a city, city of red skies,	Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
1	7243	16947	Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.	Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
1	7244	16948	Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,	"She said, ""Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."""
1	7245	16949	You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,	But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
0	7246	16950	Someone got a hold of my heart,	Someone got a hold of my heart,
1	7247	16951	Someone got a hold of my heart,	You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
1	7248	16952	I can hear that hotblooded singer on the bandstand croon	"""Poison Love"", ""Red Roses for Blue Lady"", and ""Memphis in June"""
1	7249	16953	While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powderblue wig.	I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
1	7250	16954	I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,	What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
1	7251	16955	Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,	Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
0	7252	16956	Someone got a hold of my heart,	Someone got a hold of my heart,
1	7253	16957	Someone got a hold of my heart,	You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
0	7254	16958	Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,	Tell me, tell me before I go,
1	7255	16959	Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?	Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
0	7256	16960	Tell me,	Tell me.
1	7257	16961	Tell me, what are you focused upon?	Will it come to me after you're gone?
1	7258	16962	Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,	Should I hold you close or let you go by?
0	7259	16963	Tell me,	Tell me.
1	7260	16964	Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?	If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
1	7261	16965	Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?	Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
1	7262	16966	Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?	Tell me,
1	7263	16967	Yes, tell me.	Tell me, are those rockandroll dreams in your eyes?
1	7264	16968	Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.	Ever gone broke in a big way?
1	7265	16969	Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?	Tell me,
1	7266	16970	Hmm, tell me.	Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
1	7267	16971	How deep must I go? Where do I start?	Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
1	7268	16972	Is that a smile that I see on your face?	Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
0	7269	16973	Tell me,	Hmm, tell me.
1	7270	16974	Tell me, is that my name in your book?	Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
1	7271	16975	Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,	Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
0	7272	16976	Tell me,	Hmm, tell me.
1	7273	16977	For his age he is wise,	He's got his mother's eyes.
1	7274	16978	There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.	My only prayer is if I can't be there,
1	7275	16979	Lord, protect my child.	As his youth now unfolds,
1	7276	16980	He is centuries old,	See him at play makes me smile.
1	7277	16981	No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,	Lord, protect my child.
1	7278	16982	Well, the whole earth is asleep,	You could look at it and weep,
1	7279	16983	Few things you find are worthwhile.	And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
1	7280	16984	Lord, protect my child.	He's young and on fire,
1	7281	16985	Full of hope and desire	In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
1	7282	16986	If I fall along the way and can't see another day,	Alord, protect my child.
1	7283	16987	There'll be a time, I hear tell,	When all will be well,
1	7284	16988	When God and man will be reconciled,	But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
1	7285	16989	Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,	So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
1	7286	16990	"They sang ""Danny Boy"" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,"	The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
1	7287	16991	It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,	He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
1	7288	16992	You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,	Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
1	7289	16993	Yeah, there ain't no going back,	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
1	7290	16994	He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,	Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
1	7291	16995	"He look straight into the sun and say, ""Revenge is mine, huh?"""	But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
1	7292	16996	Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,	And your fallbythesword love affair with Errol Flynn.
1	7293	16997	In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,	Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
1	7294	16998	Well, there ain't no going back,	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
1	7295	16999	There's a retired businessman named Red,	Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
1	7296	17000	He feeds off of everyone that ahe can touch.	He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
1	7297	17001	Not somebody that you play around with much.	Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
1	7298	17002	She'll do wondrous aworks with your fate,	Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
1	7299	17003	If you don't mind sleeping with your head facedown in a plate.	Well, there ain't no going back,
1	7300	17004	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.	Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
1	7301	17005	You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,	How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
1	7302	17006	How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.	Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
1	7303	17007	A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.	They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
1	7304	17008	"Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks."	Well, there ain't no going back,
1	7305	17009	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.	They got some beautiful people out there, man,
1	7306	17010	They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.	They got mystery written all over their forehead,
1	7307	17011	"They kill babies in the crib and say, ""Only the good die young."""	They don't believe in mercy,
1	7308	17012	Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,	They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
1	7309	17013	Turn you into anything that they want you to be.	Well, there ain't no going back
1	7310	17014	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.	Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
1	7311	17015	Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,	Struck down by the strength of the will.
1	7312	17016	Ain't nothing left here, partner,	Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
1	7313	17017	From now on this'll be where you're from,	Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
1	7314	17018	Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.	Ain't no going back,
1	7315	17019	When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,	Oh, yeah!
1	7316	17020	Seen the arrow on the doorpost saying this land is condemned	All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
1	7317	17021	I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell	And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
1	7318	17022	Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,	The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
1	7319	17023	Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,	But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
1	7320	17024	See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,	Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
1	7321	17025	I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,	Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
1	7322	17026	There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,	He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
1	7323	17027	There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,	And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
1	7324	17028	Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,	But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
1	7325	17029	I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel	And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
1	7326	17030	You can look out across the fields, see me returning,	Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
1	7327	17031	From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,	You've had time to think about it for a while.
1	7328	17032	I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,	It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
1	7329	17033	It don't matter who loves who  either you'll love me or I'll love you 	When the night comes falling from the sky.
1	7330	17034	I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,	Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
1	7331	17035	Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting	With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
1	7332	17036	Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.	Who are you that I should have to lie?
1	7333	17037	You'll know everything I know down below and up above	When the night comes falling from the sky.
1	7334	17038	I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river 	And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
1	7335	17039	But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,	But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
1	7336	17040	I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,	For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
1	7337	17041	Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you	When the night comes falling from the sky.
1	7338	17042	In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,	Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
1	7339	17043	I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,	I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
1	7340	17044	For all eternity I think I will remember	That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
1	7341	17045	You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind	When the night comes falling from the sky.
1	7342	17046	Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure	Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
1	7343	17047	I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,	Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
1	7344	17048	Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,	Freedom from a world which you deny,
1	7345	17049	And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow	When the night comes falling from the sky.
1	7346	17050	I was thinking of a series of dreams	Where nothing comes up to the top,
1	7347	17051	Everything stays down where it's wounded	And comes to a permanent stop,
1	7348	17052	Wasn't thinking of anything specific	Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
1	7349	17053	Nothing too very scientific,	Just thinking of a series of dreams.
1	7350	17054	Thinking of a series of dreams	Where the time and the tempo drag
1	7351	17055	And there's no exit in any direction	'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
1	7352	17056	Wasn't making any great connection,	Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
1	7353	17057	Nothing that would pass inspection,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
1	7354	17058	Dreams where the umbrella is folded	And into the path you are hurled
1	7355	17059	And the cards are no good that you're holding	Unless they're from another world.
1	7356	17060	In one the surface was frozen,	In another I witnessed a crime,
1	7357	17061	In one I was running and in another	All I seemed to be doing was climb,
1	7358	17062	Wasn't looking for any special assistance	And not going through any great extreme,
1	7359	17063	I'd already gone the distance,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
1	7360	17064	Dreams where the umbrella is folded	And into the path you are hurled
1	7361	17065	And the cards are no good that you're holding	Unless they're from another world.
1	7362	17066	I'd already gone the distance,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
0	7363	17067	Just thinking of a series of dreams,	Just thinking of a series of dreams.
1	7364	17068	Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,	Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
1	7365	17069	He was her man, but he done her wrong.	"Albert said, ""I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long."
1	7366	17070	"Don't wait up for me, aworry about me when I'm gone."""	He was her man, but he done her wrong.
1	7367	17071	Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,	"Said to the bartender, ""Has my loving man been here?"""
1	7368	17072	He was her man, but he done her wrong.	"""Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,"
1	7369	17073	"I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."""	He was her man, he done her wrong.
1	7370	17074	Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,	She saw her Albert there aloving up Alice Fry.
1	7371	17075	He was her man, he done her wrong.	Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
1	7372	17076	Gun went off arootietoottoot and Albert fell on the floor.	He was her man, but he done her wrong.
1	7373	17077	Frankie got down upon her knees, took aAlbert into her lap,	Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
1	7374	17078	He was her man, he done her wrong.	"""Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,"
1	7375	17079	I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.	"He was my man, but he done me wrong."""
1	7376	17080	"Judge said to the jury, ""Plain as a thing can be,"	"A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."""
1	7377	17081	He was her man, but he done her wrong.	Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
1	7378	17082	"Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, ""Nearer, my God, to Thee."""	He was her man, but he done her wrong.
1	7379	17083	Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,	How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
1	7380	17084	Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,	"""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,"
1	7381	17085	But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:	"Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."""
1	7382	17086	"""Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he, ""And after that, Jim Jones,"	"It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."""
1	7383	17087	And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,	But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
1	7384	17088	For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,	But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
1	7385	17089	With the storms raging 'round us and the winds ablowing gales,	I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
1	7386	17090	"""There's no time for mischief there,"" they say. ""Remember that,"" says they,"	"""Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."""
1	7387	17091	Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,	Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
1	7388	17092	Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go	And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
1	7389	17093	And some dark night when everything is silent in the town	I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
1	7390	17094	Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,	And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
1	7391	17095	Blackjack Davey come ariding on by, whistling aloud and merry,	Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
1	7392	17096	Charmed the heart of a lady.	"""How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"""
1	7393	17097	"She answered to him with a loving smile, ""I'll be sixteen come Sunday,"	"Be sixteen come Sunday."""
1	7394	17098	"""Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey."	Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
1	7395	17099	Never will want for money.	"""Pull off, pull off them highheeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,"
1	7396	17100	Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,	"We'll both go off together."""
1	7397	17101	Well, she pulled off them highheeled shoes made of Spanish leather,	Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
1	7398	17102	They both rode off together.	That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
1	7399	17103	"The servant spoke before she thought, ""She's been with Blackjack Davey,"	"Rode off with Blackjack Davey."""
1	7400	17104	"""Well, saddle for me my coalblack stud, he's speedier than the gray."	I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
1	7401	17105	"I'll bring back my lady."""	Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
1	7402	17106	And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,	Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
1	7403	17107	"""Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,"	Give to me your lilywhite hand and we'll go home together,
1	7404	17108	"We'll both go home together."""	Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
1	7405	17109	Gave to him her lilywhite hand and say goodbye forever,	Bid farewell forever.
1	7406	17110	"""Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?"	Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
1	7407	17111	"Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"""	"""Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,"
1	7408	17112	I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,	Love my Blackjack Davey.
1	7409	17113	"""Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,"	Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
1	7410	17114	Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.	She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
1	7411	17115	For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.	She longed to see that seaport town of Canadeeio.
1	7412	17116	So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.	Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
1	7413	17117	"Saying, ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue."	"You'll see that seaport town of Canadeeio."""
1	7414	17118	Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage	And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
1	7415	17119	"Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her."	"She'll never see that seaport town called Canadeeio."""
1	7416	17120	Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage	And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
1	7417	17121	"Saying, ""She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue."	"She'll see that seaport town called Canadeeio."""
1	7418	17122	Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,	She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
1	7419	17123	She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,	Finest of the ladies down Canadeeio.
1	7420	17124	Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,	I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
1	7421	17125	For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.	You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
1	7422	17126	'Twas in the summer one early fall,	Just trying to find my little all and all.
1	7423	17127	Now she's gone and I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7424	17128	'Twas in the spring one summer's day,	Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
1	7425	17129	Now she's gone, I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7426	17130	Now, don't come running holding up your hand,	Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
1	7427	17131	Now she's gone and I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7428	17132	Happen for days, didn't know your name.	Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
1	7429	17133	Now she's gone, I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7430	17134	Went to the station down in the yard,	Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
1	7431	17135	Now she's gone, I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7432	17136	The lonesome days, they have gone by.	Why should I beg you? You said goodbye.
1	7433	17137	Now she's gone, I don't worry,	Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
1	7434	17138	Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,	Rifle on her shoulder, sixshooter in her hand.
1	7435	17139	How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes	Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
1	7436	17140	Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine	Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
1	7437	17141	Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,	Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
1	7438	17142	Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,	Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
1	7439	17143	Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,	Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
1	7440	17144	Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dramglass in her hand,	She's adrinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
1	7441	17145	Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears	While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
1	7442	17146	There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,	Oh, hard times, come again no more.
1	7443	17147	'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,	Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
1	7444	17148	Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,	Oh, hard times, come again no more.
1	7445	17149	While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,	There are frail forms fainting at the door.
1	7446	17150	Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,	"""Oh, hard times, come again no more."""
1	7447	17151	'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,	Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
1	7448	17152	Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,	Oh, hard times, come again no more.
1	7449	17153	There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away	With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
1	7450	17154	Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,	"""Oh, hard times, come again no more."""
1	7451	17155	'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,	Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
1	7452	17156	Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,	Oh, hard times, come again no more.
1	7453	17157	'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,	Hard times, hard times, come again no more.

0	7469	17173	Well!	Oh!
1	7470	17174	Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight? 	Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone? 
1	7471	17175	Tomorrow night will it be just another memory 	Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
1	7472	17176	Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,	How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last? 
1	7473	17177	Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright? 	Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
1	7474	17178	Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,	And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last? 
1	7475	17179	Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright? 	Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
1	7476	17180	AMe and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,	As we went awalking down by the seaside,
1	7477	17181	Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.	Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
1	7478	17182	And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp	And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
1	7479	17183	"""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant, he cried."	"""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,"
1	7480	17184	Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.	"""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,"
1	7481	17185	Aten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist	And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
1	7482	17186	"""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life"	And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
1	7483	17187	And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.	And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
1	7484	17188	In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen	"While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."""
1	7485	17189	"""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes"	For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
1	7486	17190	And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.	And, although that we're single and free,
1	7487	17191	We take great delight in our own company,	We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
1	7488	17192	"""And we have no desire to take your advance,"	All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
1	7489	17193	"For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."""	"""Oh, no,"" says the Sergeant, ""I'll have no such chat"
1	7490	17194	And neither will take it from snappy, young brats	"For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."""
1	7491	17195	And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,	We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
1	7492	17196	When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.	And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
1	7493	17197	We flung them as far as we could in the tide.	"""Now, take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride, ""And temper their edge in the morning!"""
1	7494	17198	And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow	And we made a football of his rowdydowdow,
1	7495	17199	Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.	And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
1	7496	17200	We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,	And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
1	7497	17201	And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,	We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
1	7498	17202	For we were the lads who'd agive them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.	Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
1	7499	17203	As we went awalking down by the seaside,	Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
1	7500	17204	You're gon' quit me, baby,	Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
0	7501	17205	Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,	Good as I been to you.

0	7503	17207	Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,	Buy you shoes and clothes.
1	7504	17208	You're gon' quit me, baby,	Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
0	7505	17209	Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,	Put me outta doors.

0	7507	17211	Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,	Believe me, it ain't no fun.
1	7508	17212	Day you quit me, baby,	That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
0	7509	17213	That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,	That's the day you die.
1	7510	17214	Jailhouse ain't no plaything,	Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
0	7511	17215	Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,	Believe me, ain't no lie.
1	7512	17216	The day you quit me, baby,	That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
0	7513	17217	That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,	That's the day you die.
1	7514	17218	Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go	And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
1	7515	17219	And he carries all his money in a diamondstudded jar,	Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
1	7516	17220	I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,	He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
1	7517	17221	And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.	And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
1	7518	17222	Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,	Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
1	7519	17223	And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,	That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
1	7520	17224	I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,	I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
1	7521	17225	And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,	Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

1	7657	17361	"Just pointed out StackALee, said, ""Now what have you done?"	"You're a bad man, bad man, StackALee."""
1	7658	17362	Six big horses and a rubbertired hack	Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
1	7659	17363	All about that John B. Stetson hat.	Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
1	7660	17364	Must've been old StackALee stumbling in the dark.	He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.

1	7665	17369	He was just a blueeyed Boston boy,	His voice was low with pain.

1	7667	17371	But, if you ride back and I am left,	You'll do as much for me.

1	7669	17373	"""She's waiting at home like a patient saint,"	Her fond face pale with woe.
1	7670	17374	Her heart will be broken when I am gone,	"I'll see her soon, I know."""
1	7671	17375	Just then the order came to charge,	For an instant hand touched hand.
1	7672	17376	"They said ""Aye"" and away they rode,"	That brave and devoted band.
1	7673	17377	Straight was the track to the top of the hill,	The rebels they shot and shelled,
1	7674	17378	Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks	And guarded them as they fell.
1	7675	17379	There soon came a horrible, dying yell	From heights that they could not gain
1	7676	17380	And those whom doom and death had spared	Rode slowly back again.
1	7677	17381	But among the dead that were left on the hill	Was the boy with the curly hair.
1	7678	17382	The tall, dark man who rode by his side	Lay dead beside him there.
1	7679	17383	There's no one to write to the blueeyed girl	The words that her lover had said.
1	7680	17384	Mama, you know, awaits the news	And she'll only know he's dead.
1	7681	17385	Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,	He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
1	7682	17386	Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.	She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
1	7683	17387	There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,	Oh, her true love e'er to be.
1	7684	17388	"""Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine"	If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
1	7685	17389	"Oh, would ever suit your mind."""	"""This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine."
1	7686	17390	There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,	"Oh, would have this heart of mine."""
1	7687	17391	Now, Jack, he's gone asailing with trouble on his mind	To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
1	7688	17392	Oh, his darling girl behind.	She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
1	7689	17393	Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,	Oh, convey herself away.
1	7690	17394	"""Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."""	"She smiled all in her countenance, said, ""They call me JackARoe,"
1	7691	17395	"Oh, they call me JackARoe."""	"""Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,"
1	7692	17396	Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,	"Oh, to face the cannonball."""
1	7693	17397	"""I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,"	But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
1	7694	17398	"Oh, to see ten thousand fall."""	The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
1	7695	17399	Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,	Oh, her darling love she found.
1	7696	17400	She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town	And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
1	7697	17401	Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.	This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
1	7698	17402	This couple they got married, so why not you and me?	Oh, so why not you and me?
1	7699	17403	I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay	And pensively stood by his tomb
1	7700	17404	When in a low whisper I heard something say,	"""How sweetly I sleep here alone."""
1	7701	17405	"""The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar"	And gathering storms may arise,
1	7702	17406	But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,	"The tears are all wiped from my eyes."""
1	7703	17407	"""The calls of my master compelled me from home,"	No kindred or relative nigh.
1	7704	17408	I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,	"My soul flew to mansions on high."""
1	7705	17409	"""Go tell my companion and children most dear"	To weep not for me now I'm gone.
1	7706	17410	The same hand that led me through seas most severe	"Has kindly assisted me home."""
1	7707	17411	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
1	7708	17412	Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
1	7709	17413	And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,	Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
1	7710	17414	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
1	7711	17415	I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.	We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
1	7712	17416	Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	She turned around to look at me as I was awalking away,
1	7713	17417	"I heard her say over my shoulder, ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
1	7714	17418	I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
1	7715	17419	So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,	Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
1	7716	17420	But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,	I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
1	7717	17421	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
1	7718	17422	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
1	7719	17423	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""Don't I know your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
1	7720	17424	I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
1	7721	17425	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
1	7722	17426	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
1	7723	17427	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
1	7724	17428	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
1	7725	17429	There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,	Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
1	7726	17430	She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,	And, when it finallythe bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
1	7727	17431	The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
1	7728	17432	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
1	7729	17433	Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
1	7730	17434	But me, I'm still on the road, aheading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
1	7731	17435	Sixteen years, sixteen banners united	Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
1	7732	17436	Desperate men, desperate women divided,	Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
1	7733	17437	Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows	To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
1	7734	17438	My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows	Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
1	7735	17439	The coldblooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,	Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
1	7736	17440	Whose ebony face is beyond communication,	The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
1	7737	17441	They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,	A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
1	7738	17442	I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow	Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
1	7739	17443	I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches	With the stitches still mending 'neath a heartshaped tattoo,
1	7740	17444	Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches	Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
1	7741	17445	The palace of mirrors, where dogsoldiers are reflected,	The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
1	7742	17446	The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,	Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
1	7743	17447	She wakes him up fortyeight hours later, the sun is breaking	Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
1	7744	17448	She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,	He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
1	7745	17449	"""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""I don't need your organization,"	I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
1	7746	17450	But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination	Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
1	7747	17451	"""Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor"	On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
1	7748	17452	Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders	"With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."""
1	7749	17453	Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,	Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
1	7750	17454	Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,	Been treated like a farm animal on a wildgoose chase.
1	7751	17455	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
1	7752	17456	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
1	7753	17457	Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.	Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
1	7754	17458	'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
1	7755	17459	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
1	7756	17460	Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,	Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
1	7757	17461	But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,	I'd adone anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
1	7758	17462	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
1	7759	17463	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
1	7760	17464	I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,	There's a wall between youwhat you want and you got to leap it:
1	7761	17465	Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
1	7762	17466	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
1	7763	17467	Cities on fire, phones outta order,	They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
1	7764	17468	What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.	She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
1	7765	17469	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
1	7766	17470	Pistolshots ring out in the barroom night,	Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
1	7767	17471	She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,	"Cries out, ""My God, they've killed 'em all!"""
1	7768	17472	"Here comes the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	7769	17473	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	7770	17474	Three bodies lying there does Patty see	And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
1	7771	17475	"""I didn't do it!"" he says and he throws up his hands,"	"""I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!"
1	7772	17476	"I saw them leaving,"" he says and he stops,"	"""One of us had better call up the cops."""
1	7773	17477	And so Patty calls the cops	And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
1	7774	17478	Meanwhile far away in another part of town,	Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
1	7775	17479	The number one contender for the middleweight crown	Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
1	7776	17480	When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road 	Just like the time before and the time before that.
1	7777	17481	In Paterson, that's just the way things go:	If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
1	7778	17482	Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,	Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
1	7779	17483	"He said, ""I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,"	"Jumped into a white car with outofstate plates."""
1	7780	17484	And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,	"Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"""
1	7781	17485	So they took him to the infirmary	And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
1	7782	17486	Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,	They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
1	7783	17487	The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,	"Said, ""Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"""
1	7784	17488	"Here's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	7785	17489	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	7786	17490	Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,	Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
1	7787	17491	While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game	And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
1	7788	17492	"""Remember that murder that youhappened in a bar?"	Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
1	7789	17493	Think you'd like to play ball with the law?	"Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."""
1	7790	17494	"Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure."""	"The cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break "
1	7791	17495	We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,	If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
1	7792	17496	You'll be doing society a favor,	That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver.
1	7793	17497	We wanna put his ass in the stir,	"We wanna pin this triple murder on him  he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."""
1	7794	17498	Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,	But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
1	7795	17499	"""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""and I do it for pay"	"And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"""
1	7796	17500	Up into some paradise	Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
1	7797	17501	And ride a horse along the trail,	But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
1	7798	17502	All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,	The trial was a pigcircus, he never had a chance:
1	7799	17503	The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,	To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
1	7800	17504	And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,	No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
1	7801	17505	And, though they could not produce the gun,	The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the allwhite jury agreed.
1	7802	17506	Rubin Carter was falsely tried,	The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
1	7803	17507	Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,	The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
1	7804	17508	How can the life of such a man	Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
1	7805	17509	To see him obviously framed	Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
1	7806	17510	Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties	Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
1	7807	17511	While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell,	An innocent man in a living hell.
1	7808	17512	"Yes, that's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	But it won't be over till they clear his name
1	7809	17513	And give him back the time he's done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	7810	17514	May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,	May you always do for others and let others do for you.
1	7811	17515	May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,	May you stay forever young,
0	7812	17516	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	7813	17517	May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,	May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
1	7814	17518	May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,	And may you stay forever young,
0	7815	17519	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	7816	17520	May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,	May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
1	7817	17521	May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,	And may you stay forever young,
0	7818	17522	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	7819	17523	Standing on the water, casting your bread	While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
1	7820	17524	Distant ships sailing in through the mist,	You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
1	7821	17525	Freedom, just around the corner for you,	But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
1	7822	17526	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	7823	17527	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
1	7824	17528	You rise up and say goodbye to no one.	Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
1	7825	17529	Both of their futures so full of dread  you don't show one.	Shedding off one more layer of skin,
1	7826	17530	Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	7827	17531	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	7828	17532	You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,	Manipulator of crowds, you're a dreamtwister.
1	7829	17533	You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,	But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
1	7830	17534	Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,	You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
1	7831	17535	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	7832	17536	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
1	7833	17537	The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.	In the smoke of the twilight, on a milkwhite steed,
1	7834	17538	Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.	Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
1	7835	17539	Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	7836	17540	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	7837	17541	Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,	Preacherman seeks the same  who'll get there first is uncertain.
1	7838	17542	Nightsticks and watercannons, tear gas, padlocks,	Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
1	7839	17543	Falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,	Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
1	7840	17544	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	7841	17545	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
1	7842	17546	A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.	He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
1	7843	17547	Take the motherless children off the street,	And place them at the feet of a harlot.
1	7844	17548	Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,	Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
1	7845	17549	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	7846	17550	Fat man looking in a blade of steel,	Thin man looking at his last meal,
1	7847	17551	Hollow man looking in a cottonfield for dignity.	Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
1	7848	17552	Young man looking in the shadows that pass,	Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
1	7849	17553	Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,	Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
1	7850	17554	I went into the city, went into the town,	Went into the land of the midnight sun.
0	7851	17555	Searching high, searching low,	Searching everywhere I know,
1	7852	17556	Asking the cops wherever I go,	"""Have you seen dignity?"""
1	7853	17557	Blind man breaking out of a trance,	Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
1	7854	17558	Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.	I went to the wedding of MaryLou,
1	7855	17559	"She said, ""I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"""	Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
1	7856	17560	I went down where the vultures feed,	I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
1	7857	17561	Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,	Wasn't any difference to me.
1	7858	17562	Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,	House on fire, debts unpaid,
1	7859	17563	"Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, ""Have you seen dignity?"""	Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
1	7860	17564	In a crowded room full of coveredup mirrors,	Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
1	7861	17565	Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,	Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
1	7862	17566	He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.	Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
1	7863	17567	Steps going down into tattoo land,	I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
1	7864	17568	In the bordertowns of despair.	Got no place to fade, got no coat,
1	7865	17569	I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,	Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
1	7866	17570	Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,	Looking at hands for the lines that were
1	7867	17571	And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.	Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind,
1	7868	17572	Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,	Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
1	7869	17573	Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,	Dignity never been photographed!
1	7870	17574	I went into the red, went into the black,	Into the valley of drybone dreams.
1	7871	17575	So many roads, so much at stake,	So many deadends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
1	7872	17576	Stake my future on a hell of a past,	Looks like tomorrow is acoming on fast,
1	7873	17577	Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,	I seen better times, but who has not?
1	7874	17578	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7875	17579	Silvio, I gotta go	Find out something only dead men know.
1	7876	17580	Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,	When I come aknocking, don't throw me no bone.
1	7877	17581	I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home	And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
1	7878	17582	I can snap my fingers and require the rain	From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
1	7879	17583	I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,	Charm the whistle off an evening train.
1	7880	17584	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7881	17585	Silvio, I gotta go	Find out something only dead men know.
1	7882	17586	Give what I got until I got no more,	I take what I gets and I even the score,
1	7883	17587	You know I love you and, furthermore,	When it's time to go, you got an open door.
1	7884	17588	I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,	You give something up for everything you gain.
1	7885	17589	Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,	Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
1	7886	17590	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7887	17591	Silvio, I gotta go,	Go find out something only dead men know.
1	7888	17592	One of these days  and it won't be long 	Going down in the valley and sing my song.
1	7889	17593	Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,	Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
1	7890	17594	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7891	17595	Silvio, I gotta go	Find out something only dead men know.
1	7892	17596	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7893	17597	Silvio, I gotta go	Find out something only dead men know.
1	7894	17598	Silvio, silver and gold	Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
1	7895	17599	Silvio, I gotta go	Find out something only dead men know.
1	7896	17600	Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,	Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
1	7897	17601	For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side	And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
1	7898	17602	Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,	Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.

1	7900	17604	Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,	Ring them bells so the world will know thata God is one.
1	7901	17605	Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep	And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
0	7902	17606	Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,	Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
1	7903	17607	Ring them bells for the chosen few	Who will judge the many when the game is through,
1	7904	17608	Ring them bells for the time that flies,	For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
1	7905	17609	Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,	Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
1	7906	17610	Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong	And they're breaking down the distance between aright and wrong.

1	7935	17639	I was thinking of a series of dreams	Where nothing comes up to the top,
1	7936	17640	Everything stays down where it's wounded	And comes to a permanent stop,
1	7937	17641	Wasn't thinking of anything specific	Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
1	7938	17642	Nothing too very scientific,	Just thinking of a series of dreams.
1	7939	17643	Thinking of a series of dreams	Where the time and the tempo drag
1	7940	17644	And there's no exit in any direction	'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
1	7941	17645	Wasn't making any great connection,	Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
1	7942	17646	Nothing that would pass inspection,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
1	7943	17647	Dreams where the umbrella is folded	And into the path you are hurled
1	7944	17648	And the cards are no good that you're holding	Unless they're from another world.
1	7945	17649	In one the surface was frozen,	In another I witnessed a crime,
1	7946	17650	In one I was running and in another	All I seemed to be doing was climb,
1	7947	17651	Wasn't looking for any special assistance	And not going through any great extreme,
1	7948	17652	I'd already gone the distance,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
1	7949	17653	Dreams where the umbrella is folded	And into the path you are hurled
1	7950	17654	And the cards are no good that you're holding	Unless they're from another world.
1	7951	17655	I'd already gone the distance,	I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
0	7952	17656	Just thinking of a series of dreams,	Just thinking of a series of dreams.
1	7953	17657	Well, there was this movie I seen one time	About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
1	7954	17658	He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.	The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
1	7955	17659	Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp	As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
1	7956	17660	"""Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square."	"I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."""
1	7957	17661	Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes arolling in	And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
1	7958	17662	You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,	The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
1	7959	17663	I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert	In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
1	7960	17664	I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet 	Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
1	7961	17665	Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'	And we slept near the Alamo  your skin was so tender and soft.
1	7962	17666	Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.	I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
1	7963	17667	Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies 	Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
1	7964	17668	But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore	To remember the times when I was your only man
1	7965	17669	And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
1	7966	17670	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
1	7967	17671	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.	Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
1	7968	17672	We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live 	He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
1	7969	17673	Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,	She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
1	7970	17674	"She says, ""Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."""	Then she told us how times were tough 
1	7971	17675	And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,	But she changed the subject every time money came up.
1	7972	17676	"She said, ""Welcome to the land of the living dead"","	But you could tell she was so brokenhearted,
1	7973	17677	"She said, ""Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."""	"""How far are you all going?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh."
1	7974	17678	"""We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,"	"Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."""
1	7975	17679	"Ruby just smiled and said, ""Ah, you know some babies never learn."""	Something about that movie, though  but I just can't get it outta my head 
1	7976	17680	But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.	All I remember about it wasis Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
1	7977	17681	And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
1	7978	17682	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
1	7979	17683	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.	Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
1	7980	17684	I was crossing the street when shots rang out.	I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
1	7981	17685	"""We got him cornered in the churchyard!"" I heard somebody shout."	Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
1	7982	17686	"Underneath it it said, ""A man with no alibi""."	You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
1	7983	17687	Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,	It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
1	7984	17688	Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,	But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
1	7985	17689	Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,	You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
1	7986	17690	I could feel a whole lot better	If you were just here by my side to show me how.
1	7987	17691	Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,	Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
1	7988	17692	He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,	But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
1	7989	17693	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
1	7990	17694	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
1	7991	17695	You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.	The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter 
1	7992	17696	Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.	And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
1	7993	17697	That I liked, that was always too good for this world.	Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked 
1	7994	17698	That I left in the French Quarter.	Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections 
1	7995	17699	Than people who are most content.	I don't have any regrets  they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
1	7996	17700	You always said people don't do what they believe in,	They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
1	7997	17701	"And I always said, ""Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."""	There was a movie I seen one time  I think I sat through it twice,
1	7998	17702	I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,	All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
1	7999	17703	He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.	Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
1	8000	17704	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
1	8001	17705	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
1	8002	17706	There was a little boy and there was a little girl	And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
1	8003	17707	There was a little boy and there was a little girl	And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
1	8004	17708	There was an old man and he lived in the moon,	One summer's day he came passing by,
1	8005	17709	There was an old man and he lived in the moon	And one day he came passing by.
1	8006	17710	Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,	Someday, little girl, you'll have aa diamond as big as your shoe.
1	8007	17711	Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,	One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
1	8008	17712	Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,	One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
1	8009	17713	This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,	This is the blind horse that leads you around.
1	8010	17714	Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,	One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
1	8011	17715	Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,	Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
1	8012	17716	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
1	8013	17717	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8014	17718	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	8015	17719	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	8016	17720	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
1	8017	17721	That long, black cloud is coming down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8018	17722	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	8019	17723	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	8020	17724	Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,	City fathers, they're trying to endorse
1	8021	17725	Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,	But the town has no need to be nervous.
1	8022	17726	Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits	To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
1	8023	17727	Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits	At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
1	8024	17728	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
1	8025	17729	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
1	8026	17730	Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,	Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
1	8027	17731	"Says, ""My advice is not to let the boys in."""	Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
1	8028	17732	He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,	"""Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,"
1	8029	17733	"You will not die, it's not poison!"""	Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
1	8030	17734	Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
1	8031	17735	Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,	Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
1	8032	17736	And the National Bank at a profit sells roadmaps to the soul	To the old folks' home and the college.
1	8033	17737	I wish I could write you a melody so plain,	Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
1	8034	17738	Stop this weeping, this useless pain	Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
1	8035	17739	Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
1	8036	17740	I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,	You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
1	8037	17741	Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.	I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
1	8038	17742	I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.	Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
1	8039	17743	Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?	I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
1	8040	17744	Listen to the engine, listen to the bell	As the last firetruck from hell
1	8041	17745	Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.	It's the last temptation, the last account,
1	8042	17746	Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,	The last radio is playing.
1	8043	17747	I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,	Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
1	8044	17748	Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.	I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
1	8045	17749	"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."
1	8046	17750	Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
1	8047	17751	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke."
1	8048	17752	You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.	"Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."""
1	8049	17753	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
1	8050	17754	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
1	8051	17755	Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
1	8052	17756	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
1	8053	17757	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8054	17758	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	Keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
1	8055	17759	Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
1	8056	17760	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, theythey are achanging.
1	8057	17761	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
1	8058	17762	He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,	There's a battle outside and it's raging,
1	8059	17763	It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8060	17764	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	Don't criticize what you can't understand,
1	8061	17765	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
1	8062	17766	Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand	For your times, they are achanging.
1	8063	17767	The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
1	8064	17768	As the present now will later be past,	The order is rapidly fading
1	8065	17769	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8066	17770	John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,	His mama sure was proud of him.
1	8067	17771	He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,	His mama's face broke out into a grin.
1	8068	17772	"""Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,"	Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
1	8069	17773	Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,	"We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."""
1	8070	17774	That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,	Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
1	8071	17775	"""That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"""	She made well sure her neighbors understood.
1	8072	17776	She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,	She showed 'em to the people from next door.
1	8073	17777	They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun	In this thing she called a good, oldfashioned war.
1	8074	17778	Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,	Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
1	8075	17779	Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,	Your son is coming back from the war.
1	8076	17780	She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,	She did not see her soldier son in sight.
1	8077	17781	When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.	When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
1	8078	17782	Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away	And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
1	8079	17783	He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know	And she couldn't even recognize his face.
1	8080	17784	"""Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done."	"How is it that you've come to be this way?"""
1	8081	17785	He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move	And his mother had to turn her face away.
1	8082	17786	"""Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,"	You thought it was the best thing I could do?
1	8083	17787	I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,	"You wasn't there standing in my shoes."""
1	8084	17788	"""Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here"	Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
1	8085	17789	But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,	"I could see that his face looked just like mine."""
1	8086	17790	"""And I could not help but think through the thunderrolling stink"	That I was just a puppet in a play
1	8087	17791	And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke	"And a cannonball blew my eyes away."""
1	8088	17792	As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow	Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
1	8089	17793	But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close	And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
1	8090	17794	They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,	Stone you just like they said they would,
1	8091	17795	Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,	Stone you, they'll be back again.
1	8092	17796	I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8093	17797	They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,	Stone you when you are young and able,
1	8094	17798	Stone you and say good luck,	Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
1	8095	17799	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8096	17800	They'll stone and they'll be back for more,	Stone you and then they'll close the door,
1	8097	17801	Stone you and say that it's the end,	Stone you and they'll be back again.
1	8098	17802	I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8099	17803	They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,	The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
1	8100	17804	Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,	One hand is tied to the tightrope walker, the other is in his pants.
1	8101	17805	And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go	As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
1	8102	17806	"Cinderella, she seems so easy. ""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles,"	Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davisstyle.
1	8103	17807	"In comes Romeo, he's moaning, ""You belong to me, I believe."""	"Someone turns and says, ""You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."""
1	8104	17808	And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go	Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
1	8105	17809	Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,	The fortunetelling lady has even taken all her things inside.
1	8106	17810	All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,	Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
1	8107	17811	And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.	He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
1	8108	17812	Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,	On her twentysecond birthday she already is an old maid.
1	8109	17813	To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,	Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
1	8110	17814	And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,	She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
1	8111	17815	Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,	The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
1	8112	17816	They're spoonfeeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,	Then they'll kill him with selfconfidence after poisoning him with words.
1	8113	17817	"And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, ""Get outta here if you don't know"	"Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"""
1	8114	17818	Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew	Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
1	8115	17819	Then they bring them to the factory where the heartattack machine	Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
1	8116	17820	Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go	Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
1	8117	17821	Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.	When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
1	8118	17822	All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,	I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
1	8119	17823	Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!	Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
1	8120	17824	Fat man looking in a blade of steel,	Thin man looking at his last meal,
1	8121	17825	Hollow man looking in a cottonfield for dignity.	Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
1	8122	17826	Young man looking in the shadows that pass,	Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
1	8123	17827	Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,	Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
1	8124	17828	I went into the city, into the town,	Into the land of the midnight sun.
0	8125	17829	Searching high, searching low,	Searching everywhere I know,
1	8126	17830	Asking the cops wherever I go,	"""Have you seen dignity?"""
1	8127	17831	Blind man breaking out of a trance,	Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
1	8128	17832	Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.	I went to the wedding of MaryLou,
1	8129	17833	"She said, ""I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"""	Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
1	8130	17834	I went down where the vultures feed,	I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
1	8131	17835	I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men	And there wasn't any difference to me.
1	8132	17836	Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,	House on fire, debts unpaid,
1	8133	17837	"Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, ""Have you seen dignity?"""	Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
1	8134	17838	In a crowded room full of coveredup mirrors,	Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
1	8135	17839	I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,	Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
1	8136	17840	He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.	Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
1	8137	17841	Steps going down into tattoo land,	I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
1	8138	17842	In the bordertowns of despair.	Got no place to fade, got no coat,
1	8139	17843	I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,	Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
1	8140	17844	Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,	Looking at his hands for the lines that were
1	8141	17845	And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.	Englishman stranded in a blackheart wind,
1	8142	17846	Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,	He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
1	8143	17847	Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,	Dignity never been photographed!
1	8144	17848	I went into the red, went into the black,	Went into the valley of drybone dreams.
1	8145	17849	So many roads, so much at stake,	So many deadends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
1	8146	17850	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
1	8147	17851	It's getting dark, too dark to see	And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8148	17852	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	8149	17853	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Just like so many times before.
1	8150	17854	Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,	I just can't see through it anymore.
1	8151	17855	Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace	And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8152	17856	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	8153	17857	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Just like so many times before.
1	8154	17858	Mama, lay my guns into the ground,	I just can't fight 'em anymore.
1	8155	17859	That long, black train is pulling on down	And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8156	17860	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	8157	17861	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Just like so many times before.
1	8158	17862	We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
1	8159	17863	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"
1	8160	17864	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."	You used to laugh about
1	8161	17865	Everybody that was hanging out.	Now you don't talk so loud,
1	8162	17866	Now you don't seem so proud	'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
0	8163	17867	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	8164	17868	To be on your own,	With no direction home,
0	8165	17869	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8166	17870	You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
1	8167	17871	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
1	8168	17872	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
1	8169	17873	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
1	8170	17874	"And say, ""Do you wanna make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
0	8171	17875	How does it feel	To be without a home,
1	8172	17876	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	8173	17877	Like a rolling stone?	You never turned around to see the frowns
1	8174	17878	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
1	8175	17879	You should never let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
1	8176	17880	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
1	8177	17881	He really wasn't where it's at	After he's taken anything he can steal?
0	8178	17882	How does it feel?	How does it feel
0	8179	17883	To be without a home,	With no direction home,
0	8180	17884	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8181	17885	Princess on the steeple and all pretty people	Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
1	8182	17886	Exchanging all precious gifts and things,	But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
1	8183	17887	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
1	8184	17888	Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
1	8185	17889	You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
0	8186	17890	How does it feel	To be without a home,
1	8187	17891	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	8188	17892	Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,	The country I come from is called the Midwest,
1	8189	17893	I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide	And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
1	8190	17894	Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:	The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
1	8191	17895	The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.	Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
1	8192	17896	Now, the SpanishAmerican War had its day,	Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
1	8193	17897	And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize	With guns in their hands and God on their side.
1	8194	17898	The First World War, boys, it came and it went,	The reason for fighting I never did get,
1	8195	17899	But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride	For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
1	8196	17900	But now we've got weapons of achemical dust,	If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
1	8197	17901	One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,	And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
1	8198	17902	Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,	That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
1	8199	17903	But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide	Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
1	8200	17904	So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,	The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
1	8201	17905	The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,	That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
1	8202	17906	I'm walking through streets that are dead,	Walkingwalking with you in my head,
1	8203	17907	My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.	Did I hear someone tell a lie?
1	8204	17908	Did I hear someone's distant cry?	I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
1	8205	17909	I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,	This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
0	8206	17910	I seeI see lovers in the meadow,	I seeI see silhouettes in the window,
1	8207	17911	I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.	I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
1	8208	17912	This kind of love, II'm lovesick.	Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
1	8209	17913	Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.	Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
1	8210	17914	I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,	I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
1	8211	17915	Just don't know what to do,	I'd give anything to be with you.
0	8212	17916	Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,	Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
1	8213	17917	If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.	Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
1	8214	17918	Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,	Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a oneroom countryshack.
0	8215	17919	Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,	Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
1	8216	17920	Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.	Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
1	8217	17921	Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,	Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
0	8218	17922	Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,	Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
1	8219	17923	I'm awalking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,	Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
0	8220	17924	I got no place left to turn,	I got nothing left to burn.
1	8221	17925	Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,	It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
1	8222	17926	You left me standing in the doorway crying,	I got nothing to go back to now.
1	8223	17927	The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,	All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherryred.
1	8224	17928	I'm strumming on my gay guitar,	Smoking a cheap cigar.
1	8225	17929	The ghost of our old love has not gone away,	Don't look itlike it will anytime soon.
1	8226	17930	You left me standing in the doorway crying	Under the midnight moon.
1	8227	17931	Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,	There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
1	8228	17932	I been riding the midnight train,	Got ice water in my veins.
1	8229	17933	I would be crazy if I took you back,	It would go up against every rule.
1	8230	17934	You left me standing in the doorway crying,	Suffering like a fool.
1	8231	17935	When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,	I can hear the churchbells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
1	8232	17936	I know I can't win,	But my heart just won't give in.
1	8233	17937	Last night I danced with a stranger,	But she just reminded me you were the one.
1	8234	17938	You left me standing in the doorway crying	In the dark land of the sun.
1	8235	17939	I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,	And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
1	8236	17940	It always means so much,	Even the softest touch.
1	8237	17941	I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,	There's no words that need to be said.
1	8238	17942	You left me standing in the doorway crying,	Blues wrapped around my head.
1	8239	17943	You took a part of me that I really miss,	I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
1	8240	17944	You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.	I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8241	17945	You took the silver, you took the gold,	You left me standing out in the cold.
1	8242	17946	People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.	Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8243	17947	I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,	Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
1	8244	17948	Did so many things I never did intend to do.	Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8245	17949	I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,	I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
1	8246	17950	Sometimes I wonder to justwhat it's all coming to.	Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8247	17951	Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,	Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
1	8248	17952	Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.	Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8249	17953	Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,	"""Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."" "
1	8250	17954	"I said, ""That's alright, mama, youyou do what you gotta do."""	Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8251	17955	Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,	Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
1	8252	17956	And I'll rock you too.	I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8253	17957	Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,	I'm sitting here listening to every mindpolluting word.
1	8254	17958	I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.	Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
1	8255	17959	The air is getting hotter,	There's a rumbling in the skies,
1	8256	17960	I've been wading through the high, muddy water	With the heat rising in my eyes.
1	8257	17961	Every day your memory grows dimmer,	It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
1	8258	17962	I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,	Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
1	8259	17963	When I was in Missouri,	They would not let me be.
1	8260	17964	I had to leave there in a hurry,	I only saw what they let me see.
1	8261	17965	You broke a heart that loved you,	Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
1	8262	17966	I've been walking that lonesome valley,	Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
1	8263	17967	People on the platforms	Waiting for the trains,
1	8264	17968	I can hear their hearts abeating	Like pendulums swinging on chains.
1	8265	17969	When you think that you've lost everything,	You find out you can always lose a little more.
1	8266	17970	I'm just going down the road feeling bad,	Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
1	8267	17971	I'm going down the river,	Down to New Orleans.
1	8268	17972	They tell me everything is gonna be alright,	"But I don't know what ""alright"" even means."
1	8269	17973	I was riding in a buggy with Ms. MaryJane 	Ms. MaryJane got a house in Baltimore.
1	8270	17974	I've been all around the world, boys,	Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
1	8271	17975	Gonna sleep down in the parlor	And relive my dreams.
1	8272	17976	I close my eyes and I wonder	If everything is as hollow as it seems.
1	8273	17977	Some trains don't pull no gamblers,	No midnight ramblers like they did before.
1	8274	17978	I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,	Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
1	8275	17979	Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,	I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
1	8276	17980	I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,	Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
1	8277	17981	I just don't know what I'm gonna do,	I was alright till I fell in love with you.
1	8278	17982	Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.	Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
1	8279	17983	Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,	But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
1	8280	17984	Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,	I was alright till I fell in love with you.
1	8281	17985	Boys in the street beginning to play,	Girls like birds fly away.
1	8282	17986	When I'm gone, you will remember my name,	I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
1	8283	17987	Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,	I was alright till I fell in love with you.
1	8284	17988	Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,	My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
1	8285	17989	Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,	I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
1	8286	17990	I just don't know what to do,	I was alright till I fell in love with you.
1	8287	17991	Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,	My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
1	8288	17992	Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,	If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixiebound.
1	8289	17993	Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,	I was alright till I fell in love with you.
1	8290	17994	Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,	It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
1	8291	17995	Feel like my soul has turned into steel,	I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
1	8292	17996	There's not even room enough to be anywhere,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	8293	17997	Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,	Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
1	8294	17998	She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,	She put down in writing what was in her mind.
1	8295	17999	I just don't see why I should even care,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	8296	18000	Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,	I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
1	8297	18001	I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,	I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
1	8298	18002	Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	8299	18003	I was born here and I'll die here against my will,	I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
1	8300	18004	Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,	I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
1	8301	18005	Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	8302	18006	I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,	Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
1	8303	18007	I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,	Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
1	8304	18008	Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,	It's almost likealmost like I don't exist.
1	8305	18009	I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.	Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
1	8306	18010	Can't see over to the other side.	It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
1	8307	18011	It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.	One look at you and I'm out of control,
1	8308	18012	Like the universe has swallowed me whole.	I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
1	8309	18013	There's too many people, too many to recall,	I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
1	8310	18014	Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,	Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
1	8311	18015	I found my world, found my world in you,	But your love just hasn't proved true.
0	8312	18016	I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,	Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
1	8313	18017	Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,	Reality has always had too many heads.
1	8314	18018	Some things last longer than you think they will,	Some kinda things you can never kill.
1	8315	18019	Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,	But you can't see in and Iit's hard looking out.
1	8316	18020	I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.	Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
1	8317	18021	Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.	I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
1	8318	18022	I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.	Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
1	8319	18023	You have no idea what you do to me.	I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
1	8320	18024	When the rain is blowing in your face	And the whole world is on your case,
1	8321	18025	I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.	When the evening shadows and the stars appear
1	8322	18026	And there is no one there to dry your tears,	I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
1	8323	18027	I know you haven't made your mind up yet,	But I would never do you wrong.
1	8324	18028	I've known it from the moment that we met,	No doubt in my mind where you belong.
1	8325	18029	I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,	I'd go crawling down the avenue,
1	8326	18030	No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.	The storms are raging on the rolling sea
1	8327	18031	And on the highway of regret,	The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
1	8328	18032	You ain't seen nothing like me yet.	I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
1	8329	18033	Nothing that I wouldn't do,	Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
1	8330	18034	I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,	It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
1	8331	18035	Well, it's way past midnight and there's apeople all around,	Some on their way up, some on their way down,
1	8332	18036	The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,	And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
1	8333	18037	I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.	You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
1	8334	18038	Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm areeling from the blow,	I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
1	8335	18039	I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,	Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
1	8336	18040	Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,	Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
1	8337	18041	If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,	I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
1	8338	18042	That's how it is when things disintegrate,	And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
1	8339	18043	I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.	I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
1	8340	18044	It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,	Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
1	8341	18045	Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,	I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
1	8342	18046	I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.	I don't know how much longer I can wait.
1	8343	18047	Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,	Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air,
1	8344	18048	Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.	Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
1	8345	18049	Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,	Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
1	8346	18050	Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,	Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
1	8347	18051	I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,	Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
1	8348	18052	Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,	I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
1	8349	18053	Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,	That's where I'll be when I get called home.
1	8350	18054	The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,	Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
1	8351	18055	I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,	"Someone's always yelling, ""Turn it down!"""
1	8352	18056	Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,	I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
1	8353	18057	Insanity is smashing up against my soul,	You can say I was on anything but a roll.
1	8354	18058	If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.	What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
1	8355	18059	My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn	By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
1	8356	18060	Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.	Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
1	8357	18061	I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,	I got no idea what I want 
1	8358	18062	Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.	Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
1	8359	18063	Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,	She studies me closely as I sit down.
1	8360	18064	She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.	"I say, ""Tell me what I want."" She say, ""You probably want hardboiled eggs."""
1	8361	18065	"I say, ""That's right, bring me some."""	"Shes says, ""We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."""
1	8362	18066	"Then she says, ""I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."""	"I said, ""I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."""
1	8363	18067	"Well, she's there, she says, ""I'm right here in front of you  or haven't you looked?"""	"I say, ""Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."""
1	8364	18068	"She gives me a napkin, she say, ""You can do it on that."""	"I say, ""Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."""
1	8365	18069	She pulls one out from behind her ear,	"She says, ""Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."""
1	8366	18070	I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.	"Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, ""That don't look a thing like me."""
1	8367	18071	"I said, ""Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."""	"She say, ""You must be joking."" I said, ""I wish I was."""
1	8368	18072	"Then, she says, ""You don't read women authors, do you?"" At least that's what I think I hear her say."	"Well, I say, ""How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"""
1	8369	18073	"Well, she says, ""You just don't seem,like you do."" I said, ""You're way wrong."""	"She says, ""Which ones have you read then?"" I say, ""I've read Erica Jong."""
1	8370	18074	She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,	I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
1	8371	18075	Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,	Way up in the border country far from the towns,
1	8372	18076	With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.	My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
1	8373	18077	Every day is the same thing, out the door,	Feel further away than ever before.
1	8374	18078	Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.	Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
1	8375	18079	I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,	They're drinking and dancing, wearing brightcolored clothes,
1	8376	18080	All the young men with the young women looking so good.	Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
1	8377	18081	I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,	Talking to myself in a monologue.
1	8378	18082	I think what I need might be a fulllength leather coat.	Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
1	8379	18083	The sun is beginning to shine on me,	But it's not like the sun that used to be.
1	8380	18084	The party's over and there's less and less to say,	I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
1	8381	18085	Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,	Over the hills and far away,
1	8382	18086	There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,	But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
0	8383	18087	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
1	8384	18088	She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
1	8385	18089	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,	But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
0	8386	18090	She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,	She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
1	8387	18091	She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.	She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
1	8388	18092	She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,	She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
0	8389	18093	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
1	8390	18094	"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"" I cried she was deaf"	"As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, ""What else you got left?"""
1	8391	18095	"It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, ""Don't forget,"	"Everybody must give something back for something they get."""
1	8392	18096	"I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, ""How come?"""	"And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, ""Don't get cute."""
1	8393	18097	So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs	And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
1	8394	18098	She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,	And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
1	8395	18099	I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense	Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against 
1	8396	18100	Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.	"She said, ""No, dear."" I said, ""Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."""
1	8397	18101	She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,	And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
1	8398	18102	And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.	And youyou took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
1	8399	18103	Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?	We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
1	8400	18104	And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.	Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
1	8401	18105	In this room the heatpipes just cough,	The country music station plays soft,
1	8402	18106	But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,	Just Louise and her lover so entwined
1	8403	18107	And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.	In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the keychain
1	8404	18108	And the allnight girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,	We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
1	8405	18109	But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,	She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
1	8406	18110	But she just makes it all too concise and too clear	That Johanna's not here.
1	8407	18111	The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face	Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
1	8408	18112	Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,	He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
1	8409	18113	And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.	He's sure got a lot of gall
1	8410	18114	To be so useless and all,	Muttering small talk at the wall
1	8411	18115	While I'm in the hall.	Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
1	8412	18116	And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.	Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
1	8413	18117	"Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while"","	But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
1	8414	18118	See the primitive wallflower freeze	When the jellyfaced women all sneeze,
1	8415	18119	"Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez,"	"I can't find my knees."""
1	8416	18120	Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,	But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
1	8417	18121	The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,	"Saying, ""Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."""
1	8418	18122	"But, like Louise always says, ""You can't look at much, can you, man?"" as she herself prepares for him."	And Madonna, she still has not showed,
1	8419	18123	We see this empty cage now corrode	Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
1	8420	18124	The fiddler, he now steps to the road,	"He writes, ""Everything's been returned which was owed"""
1	8421	18125	On the back of the fish truck that loads	While my conscience explodes.
1	8422	18126	The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain	And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
1	8423	18127	You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,	But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
1	8424	18128	Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,	Crying like a fire in the sun.
1	8425	18129	Look out, the saints are coming through 	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
1	8426	18130	The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,	Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
1	8427	18131	The emptyhanded painter from your streets	Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
1	8428	18132	The sky too is folding over you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	8429	18133	All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,	All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
1	8430	18134	The lover who has just walked out your door	Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
1	8431	18135	The carpet too is moving under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
1	8432	18136	Leave your steppingstones behind, something calls for you,	Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
1	8433	18137	The vagabond who's rapping at your door	Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
1	8434	18138	Strike another match, go start anew,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
1	8435	18139	They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,	The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
1	8436	18140	Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,	One hand is tied to the tightrope walker, the other is in his pants.
1	8437	18141	And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go	As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
1	8438	18142	"Cinderella, she seems so easy. ""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles"	And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davisstyle.
1	8439	18143	"And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, ""You belong to me, I believe."""	"And someone turns and says to him, ""My friend, you'd better leave."""
1	8440	18144	And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go	Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
1	8441	18145	Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,	The fortunetelling lady has even taken all her things inside.
1	8442	18146	All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,	Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
1	8443	18147	And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.	He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
1	8444	18148	Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,	On her twentysecond birthday she already is an old maid.
1	8445	18149	Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,	Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
1	8446	18150	And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,	She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
1	8447	18151	Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,	Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
1	8448	18152	Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,	Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
1	8449	18153	You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago	For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
1	8450	18154	Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,	But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
1	8451	18155	Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,	"She also keeps the cards that read ""Have Mercy on His Soul""."
1	8452	18156	They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow	If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
1	8453	18157	Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,	The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
1	8454	18158	They are spoonfeeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,	Then they'll kill him with selfconfidence after poisoning him with words.
1	8455	18159	"And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, ""Get outta here if you don't know"	"Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"""
1	8456	18160	At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew	Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
1	8457	18161	Then they bring them to the factory where the heartattack machine	Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
1	8458	18162	Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go	Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
1	8459	18163	Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,	"Everybody's shouting, ""Which side are you on?"""
1	8460	18164	And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower	While Calypsosingers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
1	8461	18165	Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow	And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
1	8462	18166	Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the doorknob broke.	When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
1	8463	18167	All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,	I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
1	8464	18168	Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!	Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
1	8465	18169	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,	Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
1	8466	18170	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
1	8467	18171	She makes love like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
1	8468	18172	Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
1	8469	18173	Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
1	8470	18174	She makes love like a woman  yes, she does!	And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
1	8471	18175	It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
1	8472	18176	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
1	8473	18177	But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
0	8474	18178	You fake just like a woman  yes, you do!	You make love like a woman  yes, you do!
1	8475	18179	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8476	18180	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8477	18181	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
1	8478	18182	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
1	8479	18183	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
1	8480	18184	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8481	18185	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8482	18186	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
1	8483	18187	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
0	8484	18188	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
1	8485	18189	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
1	8486	18190	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8487	18191	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8488	18192	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
1	8489	18193	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
1	8490	18194	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
1	8491	18195	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
1	8492	18196	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8493	18197	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8494	18198	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	8495	18199	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
1	8496	18200	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
1	8497	18201	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
1	8498	18202	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
1	8499	18203	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
1	8500	18204	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8501	18205	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	8502	18206	Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,	Cold, black water don't make no tears.
1	8503	18207	You say you love me with what bemay be love,	Don't you remember making baby love?
1	8504	18208	Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid	To get it to work for you like your ninepound hammer did,
1	8505	18209	But I know that you know that I know that you show something	Is tearing up your mind.
1	8506	18210	Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?	What's wrong with you this time?
1	8507	18211	Black sunglass can't make pony run,	Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
1	8508	18212	Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,	Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
1	8509	18213	Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,	But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
1	8510	18214	And I know that you know that I know that you show something	Is tearing up your mind.
1	8511	18215	Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?	What's wrong with you this time?
1	8512	18216	Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red 	The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
1	8513	18217	Everybody sees you on your window ledge.	How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
1	8514	18218	You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.	Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
1	8515	18219	I know that you know that I know that you show something	Is tearing up your mind.
1	8516	18220	Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?	What's wrong with you this time?
1	8517	18221	"This is called ""I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)""."	Well, I can't understand,
1	8518	18222	She let go of my hand	And left me here facing the wall.
1	8519	18223	Yes, I'd sure like to know	Why she did go,
1	8520	18224	But I can't get close to her at all.	Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
1	8521	18225	She said she would never forget,	But morning is clear
1	8522	18226	And it's like I ain't here,	She just acts like we never have met.
1	8523	18227	Well, it's all new to me	Like some mystery,
1	8524	18228	It could even be like a myth,	But it's hard to think on
1	8525	18229	That she's the same one	That last night I was with.
1	8526	18230	Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,	But am I still dreaming yet?
1	8527	18231	I wish she'd unlock	Her voice once and talk
1	8528	18232	'Stead of acting like we never have met.	If I didn't have to guess,
1	8529	18233	I'd gladly confess	To anything I might've tried.
1	8530	18234	If I was with her too long	Or have done something wrong,
1	8531	18235	I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.	Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
1	8532	18236	Her mouth was watery and wet,	But something has changed
1	8533	18237	For she ain't the same,	She just acts like we never have met.
0	8534	18238	I'm leaving today,	I'll be on my way,
1	8535	18239	Of this I can't say very much,	But, if you want me to,
1	8536	18240	I can be just like you	And pretend that we never have touched.
1	8537	18241	And, if anybody asks me,	"""Is it easy to forget?"""
1	8538	18242	"I'll say, ""It's easily done,"	Just pick anyone
0	8539	18243	Baby, let me follow you down,	Baby, let me follow you down,
1	8540	18244	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just let me follow you down.
0	8541	18245	I'll buy you a diamond ring,	Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
1	8542	18246	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just let me follow you down.
0	8543	18247	Can I come home with you?	Baby, can I come home with you?
1	8544	18248	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just let me come home with you.
1	8545	18249	I'll buy you rope and twine,	Honey, just for you to climb,
1	8546	18250	Yes, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just once drive me outta my mind.
1	8547	18251	I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,	I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
1	8548	18252	Yes, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If it just don't make me hurts.
0	8549	18253	Baby, let me follow you down,	Baby, let me follow you down,
1	8550	18254	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just let me follow you down.
0	8551	18255	Baby, let me follow you down,	Baby, let me follow you down,
1	8552	18256	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world	If you just let me follow you down.
1	8553	18257	When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Eastertime too	And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
1	8554	18258	Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,	They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
1	8555	18259	"Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her ""Thanks a lot"","	I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
1	8556	18260	I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot	And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
1	8557	18261	"Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the ""Goddess of Gloom"","	She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
1	8558	18262	And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon	And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
1	8559	18263	Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,	You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
1	8560	18264	If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came	Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
1	8561	18265	Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast	How they blackmailed the sergeantatarms into getting up and leaving his post
1	8562	18266	And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,	Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
1	8563	18267	Alright!	I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
1	8564	18268	Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,	Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
1	8565	18269	"This is cathis is called ""Yes""  this is, uh, this is called ""Yes, I See You've Got Your BrandNew LeopardSkin PillBox Hat."""	Well, I see you got your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat,
1	8566	18270	Yes, I see you got your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.	Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
1	8567	18271	Under your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.	Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
1	8568	18272	Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.	You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
1	8569	18273	Your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.	Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
1	8570	18274	Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,	Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
1	8571	18275	In your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.	"Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. ""It's bad for your health,"" he said."
1	8572	18276	Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.	You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
1	8573	18277	Your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.	Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
1	8574	18278	Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.	You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
1	8575	18279	...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.	Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
1	8576	18280	As the night comes in afalling, the dogs will lose their bark,	And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
1	8577	18281	Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.	From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
1	8578	18282	And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid	And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
1	8579	18283	And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.	It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
1	8580	18284	When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.	Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
1	8581	18285	You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,	"You see somebody naked, you say, ""Who is that man?"""
1	8582	18286	You try so hard, but you don't understand	Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
1	8583	18287	Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You walk in so politely, you say, ""Is this where it is?"""
1	8584	18288	"And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his."""	"You say, ""What's mine?"" Somebody else says, ""Where what is?"""
1	8585	18289	"And you say, ""Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"""	Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
1	8586	18290	You hand in your money to go watch the geek,	Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
1	8587	18291	"Saying, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?"""	"You say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone."
1	8588	18292	Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
1	8589	18293	To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.	Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
1	8590	18294	You just to give away your check to taxdeductible charity organizations.	Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
1	8591	18295	With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,	You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
1	8592	18296	You're verywell read, it's wellknown.	Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
1	8593	18297	The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,	He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
1	8594	18298	And without further notice he tells you how it feels	"And says, ""Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"""
1	8595	18299	Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You see this oneeyed midget shouting the word ""now"""
1	8596	18300	"And you say, ""For what reason?"" And he says, ""How?"""	"And you say, ""Oh, my God, what does that mean?"" And he screams back, ""You're a cow!"
1	8597	18301	"Give me some milk or else go home!"""	Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
1	8598	18302	You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,	You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
1	8599	18303	There oughtta be a law against you coming around,	You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
0	8600	18304	I don't believe you.	You're a liar!
1	8601	18305	Play fucking loud!	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
1	8602	18306	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"
1	8603	18307	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."	You used to laugh about
1	8604	18308	Everybody that was hanging out.	Now you don't talk so loud,
1	8605	18309	Now you don't seem so proud	About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
0	8606	18310	How does it feel?	How does it feel
0	8607	18311	To be one your own,	No direction home,
0	8608	18312	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8609	18313	Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
1	8610	18314	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,	You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
1	8611	18315	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
1	8612	18316	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
1	8613	18317	"And say, ""Do you wanna make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
0	8614	18318	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	8615	18319	No direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	8616	18320	Like a rolling stone?	Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
1	8617	18321	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
1	8618	18322	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
1	8619	18323	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
1	8620	18324	He really wasn't where it's at	After he's taken everything he can steal?
0	8621	18325	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	8622	18326	To be on your own,	With no direction home,
0	8623	18327	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8624	18328	Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
1	8625	18329	Exchanging all precious gifts and things,	But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
1	8626	18330	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
1	8627	18331	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
1	8628	18332	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	8629	18333	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	8630	18334	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	8631	18335	Like a rolling stone?	Thank you.
1	8632	18336	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
1	8633	18337	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
1	8634	18338	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
0	8635	18339	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	8636	18340	Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
1	8637	18341	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
1	8638	18342	Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
0	8639	18343	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	8640	18344	Yes, and how many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
1	8641	18345	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
1	8642	18346	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
0	8643	18347	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	8644	18348	Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	If'n you don't know by now.
1	8645	18349	And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 	It'll never do, somehow.
1	8646	18350	When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,	Look out your window and I'll be gone.
1	8647	18351	You're the reason I'm traveling on,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
1	8648	18352	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,	The light I never knowed.
1	8649	18353	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe 	I'm on the dark side of the road.
1	8650	18354	But I wish there was something you would do or say	To try and make me change my mind and stay.
1	8651	18355	But we never did too much talking, anyway.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
1	8652	18356	So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,	Like you never done before.
1	8653	18357	And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal 	I can't hear you anymore.
1	8654	18358	I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.	I once loved a woman  a child, I am told.
1	8655	18359	I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
1	8656	18360	So long, honey babe.	Where I'm bound I can't tell.
1	8657	18361	Goodbye's too good a word, babe,	"So I'll just say ""Fare thee well""."
1	8658	18362	I ain't saying you treated me unkind.	You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
1	8659	18363	You just kinda wasted my precious time,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
1	8660	18364	Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
1	8661	18365	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
1	8662	18366	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8663	18367	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
1	8664	18368	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
1	8665	18369	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8666	18370	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
1	8667	18371	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.	The battle outside raging
1	8668	18372	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8669	18373	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
1	8670	18374	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
1	8671	18375	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8672	18376	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
1	8673	18377	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
1	8674	18378	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
1	8675	18379	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
0	8676	18380	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'm not the one you need.
1	8677	18381	You say you're looking for someone	Who's never weak, but always strong,
1	8678	18382	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
1	8679	18383	Someone to open each and every door.	But it ain't me, babe,
1	8680	18384	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	8681	18385	Go lightly from the ledge, babe,	Go lightly on the ground.
1	8682	18386	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I will only let you down.
1	8683	18387	You say you're looking for someone	Who will promise never to part,
0	8684	18388	Someone to close his eyes for you,	Someone to close his heart,
1	8685	18389	Someone who will die for you and more.	But it ain't me, babe,
1	8686	18390	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	8687	18391	Go melt back in the night,	Everything inside is made of stone.
1	8688	18392	There's nothing in here moving	And, anyway, I'm not alone.
1	8689	18393	You say you're looking for someone	Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
1	8690	18394	To gather flowers constantly,	And to come each time you call,
1	8691	18395	A lover for your life and nothing more.	But it ain't me, babe,
1	8692	18396	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	8693	18397	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	8694	18398	Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.	I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
1	8695	18399	It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	8696	18400	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
1	8697	18401	Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.	He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
1	8698	18402	Then he fines you every time you slam the door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
0	8699	18403	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
1	8700	18404	Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,	His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
1	8701	18405	The National Guard stands around his door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
0	8702	18406	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
1	8703	18407	Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,	Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
1	8704	18408	She's 68, but she says she's 54.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
0	8705	18409	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	8706	18410	Well, I try my best to be just like I am,	But everybody wants you to be just like them.
1	8707	18411	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave and I just get bored."	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	8708	18412	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8709	18413	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8710	18414	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
1	8711	18415	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
1	8712	18416	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
1	8713	18417	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8714	18418	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8715	18419	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
1	8716	18420	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
0	8717	18421	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
1	8718	18422	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
1	8719	18423	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8720	18424	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8721	18425	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
1	8722	18426	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
1	8723	18427	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
1	8724	18428	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
1	8725	18429	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8726	18430	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8727	18431	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	8728	18432	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
1	8729	18433	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
1	8730	18434	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
1	8731	18435	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
1	8732	18436	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
1	8733	18437	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	8734	18438	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	8735	18439	Johnny's in the basement	Mixing up the medicine,
1	8736	18440	I'm on the pavement	Thinking about the government,
1	8737	18441	The man in the trenchcoat,	Badge out, laid off,
1	8738	18442	Says he's got a bad cough,	Wants to get it paid off.
1	8739	18443	Look out, kid,	It's something you did
1	8740	18444	God knows when,	But you're doing it again,
1	8741	18445	You better duck down the alleyway,	Looking for a new friend.
1	8742	18446	The man in the coonskin cap	In the pigpen
1	8743	18447	Wants eleven dollar bills,	You only got ten.
1	8744	18448	Maggie comes fleetfoot,	Face full of black soot,
0	8745	18449	Talking that the heat put	Plants in the bed, but
1	8746	18450	The phone's tapped anyway,	Maggie says that many say
1	8747	18451	They must bust in early May,	Orders from the D.A.
1	8748	18452	Look out, kid,	Don't matter what you did,
1	8749	18453	Don't walk on your tiptoes,	Don't try No Doz,
1	8750	18454	Better stay away from those	That carry 'round a firehose,
0	8751	18455	Keep a clean nose,	Watch the plainclothes,
1	8752	18456	You don't need a weatherman	To know which way the wind blows.
1	8753	18457	Ah, get sick, get well,	Hang around the inkwell,
1	8754	18458	Ring bell, hard to tell	If anything is gonna sell,
1	8755	18459	Try hard, get barred,	Get back, write Braille,
1	8756	18460	Get jailed, jump bail,	Join the army if you fail.
1	8757	18461	Look out, kid,	You're gonna get hit
0	8758	18462	By losers, cheaters,	Sixtime users
1	8759	18463	Hanging 'round the theaters,	Girl by the whirlpool's
1	8760	18464	Looking for a new fool,	Don't follow leaders,
1	8761	18465	Watch the parking meters.	Oh, get born, keep warm,
1	8762	18466	Short pants, romance, learn to dance,	Get dressed, get blessed,
1	8763	18467	Try to be a success,	Please her, please him, buy gifts,
1	8764	18468	Don't steal, don't lift,	Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
0	8765	18469	Look out, kid,	They keep it all hid,
1	8766	18470	Better jump down a manhole,	Light yourself a candle,
1	8767	18471	Don't wear sandals	And try to avoid the scandals.
0	8768	18472	Don't wanna be a bum,	You better chew gum,
1	8769	18473	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
1	8770	18474	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."
1	8771	18475	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out.
0	8772	18476	Now you don't talk so loud.	Now you don't seem so proud
1	8773	18477	About having to be scrounging your next meal.	How does it feel?
0	8774	18478	How does it feel	To be without a home,
0	8775	18479	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8776	18480	Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
1	8777	18481	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
1	8778	18482	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
1	8779	18483	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
1	8780	18484	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
0	8781	18485	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	8782	18486	With no direction home,	A complete unknown,
1	8783	18487	Like a rolling stone?	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
1	8784	18488	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
1	8785	18489	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
1	8786	18490	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
1	8787	18491	He really wasn't where it's at	After he took from you everything he could steal?
0	8788	18492	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	8789	18493	To havebe on your own,	With no direction home,
0	8790	18494	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	8791	18495	Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
1	8792	18496	Exchanging all precious gifts,	But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
1	8793	18497	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
1	8794	18498	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
1	8795	18499	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	8796	18500	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	8797	18501	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	8798	18502	You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,	When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
1	8799	18503	You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,	You just want to be on the side that's winning.
1	8800	18504	You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.	If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
1	8801	18505	You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,	You had no faith to lose and you know it.
1	8802	18506	I know the reason that you talk behind my back,	I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
1	8803	18507	Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact	With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
1	8804	18508	You see me on the street, you always act surprised,	"You say, ""How are you?"", ""Good luck"", but you don't mean it"
1	8805	18509	When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed 	Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
1	8806	18510	No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,	If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
1	8807	18511	And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.	Don't you understand it's not my problem?
1	8808	18512	I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes	And just for that one moment I could be you.
1	8809	18513	Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,	You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
1	8810	18514	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.	Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
1	8811	18515	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
1	8812	18516	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
1	8813	18517	Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
1	8814	18518	Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.	She takes just like a woman  yes!
1	8815	18519	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
1	8816	18520	It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
1	8817	18521	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
1	8818	18522	And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
0	8819	18523	Ah, you fake just like a woman  yes, you do!	You make love just like a woman  yes, you do!
1	8820	18524	Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,	They'll stone you just like they said they would,
1	8821	18525	They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,	Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
1	8822	18526	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8823	18527	Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,	They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
0	8824	18528	They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,	They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
1	8825	18529	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8826	18530	They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,	They'll stone you when you are young and able,
1	8827	18531	They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,	"They'll stone you and then they'll say, ""Good luck."""
1	8828	18532	Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8829	18533	Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,	Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
0	8830	18534	They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,	They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
1	8831	18535	Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	8832	18536	Alright!	Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
1	8833	18537	They'll stone you when you are walking home,	"They'll stone you and then say, ""You are brave,"""
1	8834	18538	They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.	But I would not feel so all alone,
1	8835	18539	"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."
1	8836	18540	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
1	8837	18541	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
1	8838	18542	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."""
1	8839	18543	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
1	8840	18544	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
1	8841	18545	Everybody's building the big ships and boats,	Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
1	8842	18546	Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
1	8843	18547	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
1	8844	18548	Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,	But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
1	8845	18549	Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
1	8846	18550	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
1	8847	18551	Now, lampgates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,	Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
1	8848	18552	Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
1	8849	18553	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
1	8850	18554	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
1	8851	18555	Close your eyes, close the door.	You don't have to worry any more.
1	8852	18556	I'll be your baby tonight.	Shut the light, shut the shade.
1	8853	18557	You don't have to be afraid.	I'll be your baby tonight.
1	8854	18558	Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  we're gonna forget it.	That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
1	8855	18559	Kick your shoes off, do not fear.	Bring that bottle over here.
0	8856	18560	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
1	8857	18561	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
1	8858	18562	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
1	8859	18563	Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but hishis hands are clean
1	8860	18564	And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
1	8861	18565	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it too.
1	8862	18566	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
1	8863	18567	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
1	8864	18568	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach for you in the night.
1	8865	18569	If not for you,	Babe, I couldn't find the door,
1	8866	18570	Couldn't even see the floor,	I'd be sad and blue,
0	8867	18571	If not for you.	If not for you,
1	8868	18572	Babe, I'd lay awake all night,	Wait for the morning light
1	8869	18573	To shine in through,	But it would not be new,
1	8870	18574	If not for you.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
1	8871	18575	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
1	8872	18576	I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
1	8873	18577	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
1	8874	18578	Oh, what would I do if not for you?	If not for you,
1	8875	18579	Winter would have no spring,	I couldn't hear the robin sing,
1	8876	18580	I just wouldn't have a clue,	Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
0	8877	18581	If not for you,	If not for you,
0	8878	18582	If not for you,	If not for you,
0	8879	18583	They say every man must need protection,	They say every man must fall,
1	8880	18584	Yet I swear I see my reflection	Some place so high above the wall.
1	8881	18585	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
1	8882	18586	Down here next to me in this lonely crowd	There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
1	8883	18587	All day long I hear him cry so loud,	Calling out that he's been framed.
1	8884	18588	Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
1	8885	18589	"Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called ""Gunga Din"" "	Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't agoing nowhere!
1	8886	18590	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
1	8887	18591	Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:	"""We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."""
1	8888	18592	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
1	8889	18593	Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,	Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
1	8890	18594	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
1	8891	18595	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
1	8892	18596	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
1	8893	18597	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8894	18598	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	8895	18599	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	8896	18600	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
1	8897	18601	That long, black cloud is coming down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	8898	18602	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	8899	18603	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	8900	18604	May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,	May you always do for others and let others do for you.
1	8901	18605	May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,	May you stay forever young,
0	8902	18606	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	8903	18607	May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,	May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
1	8904	18608	May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,	And may you stay forever young,
0	8905	18609	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	8906	18610	May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,	May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
1	8907	18611	May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,	And may you stay forever young,
0	8908	18612	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
1	8909	18613	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
1	8910	18614	Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
1	8911	18615	And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,	Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
1	8912	18616	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
1	8913	18617	I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.	We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
1	8914	18618	Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	She turned around to look at me as I was awalking away,
1	8915	18619	"I heard her say over my shoulder, ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
1	8916	18620	I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
1	8917	18621	So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,	Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
1	8918	18622	But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,	I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
1	8919	18623	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
1	8920	18624	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
1	8921	18625	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""Don't I know your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
1	8922	18626	I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
1	8923	18627	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
1	8924	18628	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
1	8925	18629	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
1	8926	18630	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
1	8927	18631	There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,	Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
1	8928	18632	She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,	And, when it finallythe bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
1	8929	18633	The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
1	8930	18634	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
1	8931	18635	Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
1	8932	18636	But me, I'm still on the road, aheading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
1	8933	18637	Pistolshots ring out in the barroom night,	Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
1	8934	18638	She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,	"Cries out, ""My God, they've killed 'em all!"""
1	8935	18639	"Here comes the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	8936	18640	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	8937	18641	Three bodies lying there does Patty see	And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
1	8938	18642	"""I didn't do it!"" he says and he throws up his hands,"	"""I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!"
1	8939	18643	"I saw them leaving,"" he says and he stops,"	"""One of us had better call up the cops."""
1	8940	18644	And so Patty calls the cops	And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
1	8941	18645	Meanwhile far away in another part of town,	Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
1	8942	18646	The number one contender for the middleweight crown	Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
1	8943	18647	When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road 	Just like the time before and the time before that.
1	8944	18648	In Paterson, that's just the way things go:	If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
1	8945	18649	Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,	Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
1	8946	18650	"He said, ""I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,"	"Jumped into a white car with outofstate plates."""
1	8947	18651	And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,	"Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"""
1	8948	18652	So they took him to the infirmary	And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
1	8949	18653	Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,	They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
1	8950	18654	The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,	"Said, ""Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"""
1	8951	18655	"Here's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	8952	18656	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	8953	18657	Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,	Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
1	8954	18658	While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game	And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
1	8955	18659	"""Remember that murder that youhappened in a bar?"	Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
1	8956	18660	Think you'd like to play ball with the law?	"Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."""
1	8957	18661	"Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure."""	"The cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break "
1	8958	18662	We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,	If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
1	8959	18663	You'll be doing society a favor,	That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver.
1	8960	18664	We wanna put his ass in the stir,	"We wanna pin this triple murder on him  he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."""
1	8961	18665	Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,	But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
1	8962	18666	"""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""and I do it for pay"	"And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"""
1	8963	18667	Up into some paradise	Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
1	8964	18668	And ride a horse along the trail,	But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
1	8965	18669	All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,	The trial was a pigcircus, he never had a chance:
1	8966	18670	The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,	To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
1	8967	18671	And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,	No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
1	8968	18672	And, though they could not produce the gun,	The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the allwhite jury agreed.
1	8969	18673	Rubin Carter was falsely tried,	The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
1	8970	18674	Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,	The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
1	8971	18675	How can the life of such a man	Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
1	8972	18676	To see him obviously framed	Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
1	8973	18677	Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties	Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
1	8974	18678	While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell,	An innocent man in a living hell.
1	8975	18679	"Yes, that's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	But it won't be over till they clear his name
1	8976	18680	And give him back the time he's done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	8977	18681	Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,	Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
1	8978	18682	For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side	And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
1	8979	18683	Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,	Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
1	8980	18684	Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow	And the sun is agoing down upon the sacred cow.
1	8981	18685	Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,	Ring them bells so the world will know thata God is one.
1	8982	18686	Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep	And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
0	8983	18687	Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,	Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
1	8984	18688	Ring them bells for the chosen few	Who will judge the many when the game is through,
1	8985	18689	Ring them bells for the time that flies,	For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
1	8986	18690	Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,	Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
1	8987	18691	Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong	And they're breaking down the distance between aright and wrong.

1	9016	18720	Standing on the water, casting your bread	While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
1	9017	18721	Distant ships sailing in through the mist,	You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
1	9018	18722	Freedom, just around the corner for you,	But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
1	9019	18723	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9020	18724	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
1	9021	18725	You rise up and say goodbye to no one.	Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
1	9022	18726	Both of their futures so full of dread  you don't show one.	Shedding off one more layer of skin,
1	9023	18727	Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	9024	18728	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	9025	18729	You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,	Manipulator of crowds, you're a dreamtwister.
1	9026	18730	You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,	But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
1	9027	18731	Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,	You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
1	9028	18732	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9029	18733	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
1	9030	18734	The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.	In the smoke of the twilight, on a milkwhite steed,
1	9031	18735	Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.	Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
1	9032	18736	Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	9033	18737	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	9034	18738	Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,	Preacherman seeks the same  who'll get there first is uncertain.
1	9035	18739	Nightsticks and watercannons, tear gas, padlocks,	Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
1	9036	18740	Falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,	Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
1	9037	18741	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9038	18742	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
1	9039	18743	A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.	He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
1	9040	18744	Take the motherless children off the street,	And place them at the feet of a harlot.
1	9041	18745	Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,	Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
1	9042	18746	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9043	18747	Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,	It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
1	9044	18748	Feel like my soul has turned into steel,	I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
1	9045	18749	There's not even room enough to be anywhere,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9046	18750	Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,	Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
1	9047	18751	She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,	She put down in writing what was in her mind.
1	9048	18752	I just don't see why I should even care,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9049	18753	Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,	I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
1	9050	18754	I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,	I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
1	9051	18755	Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9052	18756	I was born here and I'll die here against my will,	I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
1	9053	18757	Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,	I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
1	9054	18758	Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9055	18759	A worried man with a worried mind,	No one in front of me and nothing behind,
1	9056	18760	There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,	Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
1	9057	18761	I'm looking up into the sapphiretinted skies,	I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
1	9058	18762	Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,	Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
1	9059	18763	People are crazy, times are strange,	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
1	9060	18764	I used to care, but things have changed.	This place ain't doing me any good,
1	9061	18765	I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,	Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
1	9062	18766	Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,	Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
1	9063	18767	Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.	Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
1	9064	18768	Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.	People are crazy, times are strange,
1	9065	18769	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,	I used to care, but things have changed.
1	9066	18770	I've been walking forty miles of bad road,	If the bible is right, the world will explode,
1	9067	18771	I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.	Some things are too hot to touch,
1	9068	18772	The human mind can only stand so much,	You can't win with a losing hand.
1	9069	18773	Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,	Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street.
1	9070	18774	People are crazy, times are strange,	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
1	9071	18775	I used to care, but things have changed.	I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
1	9072	18776	You can hurt someone and not even know it,	The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
1	9073	18777	Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high,	All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
1	9074	18778	I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.	Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
1	9075	18779	I'm not that eager to make a mistake.	People are crazy, times are strange,
1	9076	18780	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.	I used to care, but things have changed.
1	9077	18781	When the rain is blowing in your face	And the whole world is on your case,
1	9078	18782	I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.	When the evening shadows and the stars appear
1	9079	18783	And there is no one there to dry your tears,	I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
1	9080	18784	I know you haven't made your mind up yet,	But I would never do you wrong.
1	9081	18785	I've known it from the moment that we met,	No doubt in my mind where you belong.
1	9082	18786	I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,	I'd go crawling down the avenue,
1	9083	18787	No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.	The storms are raging on the rolling sea
1	9084	18788	And on the highway of regret,	The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
1	9085	18789	You ain't seen nothing like me yet.	I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
1	9086	18790	Nothing that I wouldn't do,	Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
1	9087	18791	Every step of the way we walk the line,	Your days are numbered, so are mine.
1	9088	18792	Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,	We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
1	9089	18793	City's just a jungle, more games to play,	Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
1	9090	18794	I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,	I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
1	9091	18795	Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,	Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
1	9092	18796	Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,	Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
1	9093	18797	All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime	Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
1	9094	18798	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
1	9095	18799	Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,	Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
1	9096	18800	I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,	I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
1	9097	18801	Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,	Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
1	9098	18802	So many things that we never will undo;	I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
1	9099	18803	Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,	Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
1	9100	18804	I need something strong to distract my mind,	I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
1	9101	18805	Well, I got here following the Southern Star,	I crossed that river just to be where you are.
1	9102	18806	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
1	9103	18807	Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,	I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
1	9104	18808	But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,	I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
1	9105	18809	Everybody moving  if they ain't already there,	Everybody got to move somewhere.
1	9106	18810	Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,	Things should start to get interesting right about now.
1	9107	18811	My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,	Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
1	9108	18812	I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,	So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
1	9109	18813	Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,	You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
1	9110	18814	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
1	9111	18815	I love you, pretty baby,	You're the only love I've ever known.
1	9112	18816	Just as long as you stay with me,	The whole world is my throne.
1	9113	18817	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing we can call our own
1	9114	18818	I'm moving after midnight	Down boulevards of broken cars,
1	9115	18819	Don't know what to do without it,	Without this love that we call ours.
1	9116	18820	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing but the moon and stars.
1	9117	18821	Down every street there's a window	And every window made of glass.
1	9118	18822	We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,	For as long as love will last.
1	9119	18823	Beyond here lies nothing	But the mountains of the past.
1	9120	18824	My ship is in the harbor	And the sails are spread.
1	9121	18825	Listen to me, pretty baby,	Lay your hand upon my head.
1	9122	18826	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing done and nothing said.
1	9123	18827	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
1	9124	18828	I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,	That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
1	9125	18829	You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,	But I ain't neither one.
1	9126	18830	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Sound like it's on a final run.
1	9127	18831	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like she never blowed before,
1	9128	18832	Little light blinking, red light glowing,	Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
1	9129	18833	You smiling through the fence at me	Just like you've always smiled before.
1	9130	18834	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
1	9131	18835	Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?	Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
1	9132	18836	You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,	You're like a time bomb in my heart.
1	9133	18837	I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,	Must be the mother of Our Lord.
1	9134	18838	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like my woman's on board.
1	9135	18839	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
1	9136	18840	You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,	I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
1	9137	18841	I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,	Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
1	9138	18842	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
1	9139	18843	Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?	Blowing through another nogood town.
1	9140	18844	The lights on my native land are glowing,	I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
1	9141	18845	I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,	That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
1	9142	18846	Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,	Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
1	9143	18847	In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,	Where wisdom grows up in strife,
1	9144	18848	My bewildering brain toils in vain,	Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
1	9145	18849	Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,	Tomorrow keeps turning around.
1	9146	18850	We live and we die, we know not why,	But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
1	9147	18851	We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,	Far down the street we stray.
1	9148	18852	I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by	Things I never meant nor wished to say.
1	9149	18853	The midnight rain follows the train,	We all wear the same thorny crown.
1	9150	18854	Soul to soul our shadows roll	And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
1	9151	18855	The moon gives light and shines by night,	I scarcely feel the glow.
1	9152	18856	We learn to live and then we forgive,	O'er the road we're bound to go.
1	9153	18857	More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours	That keep us so tightly bound.
1	9154	18858	You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies	And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
1	9155	18859	I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,	I followed the winding stream.
1	9156	18860	I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,	I know they're not what they seem.
1	9157	18861	In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain	You'll never see me frown.
1	9158	18862	I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true	And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
1	9159	18863	Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,	They're throwing knives into the tree,
1	9160	18864	Two big bags of dead man's bones,	Got their noses to the grindstones.
1	9161	18865	Living in the land of Nod,	Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
1	9162	18866	They pass by so silently,	Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
1	9163	18867	Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,	"They're taking a streetcar named ""Desire"","
1	9164	18868	Looking at the window at the pecan pie,	Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
1	9165	18869	Neither one gonna turn and run,	They're making a voyage to the sun.
1	9166	18870	"""His Master's voice is calling me,"""	Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
1	9167	18871	Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,	All that and more and then some,
1	9168	18872	They walk among the stately trees,	They know the secrets of the breeze.
1	9169	18873	Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,	"""Your presence is obnoxious to me."""
1	9170	18874	They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,	Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
1	9171	18875	Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,	I got love for you and it's all in vain.
1	9172	18876	Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,	They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
1	9173	18877	Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,	"Saying, ""Throw me something, mister, please."""
1	9174	18878	"""What's good for you is good for me,"""	Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
1	9175	18879	Well, they're living in a happy harmony,	Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
1	9176	18880	They're one day older and a dollar short,	They got a parade permit and a police escort.
1	9177	18881	They're lying low and they're making hay,	They seem determined to go all the way.
1	9178	18882	They run a brick and tile company,	Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
1	9179	18883	Well, a childish dream is a deathless need	And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
1	9180	18884	My pretty baby, she's looking around,	She's wearing a multithousand dollar gown.
1	9181	18885	Tweedle Dee, he's a lowdown, sorry, old man,	Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
1	9182	18886	"""I've had too much of your company,"""	Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
1	9183	18887	Every step of the way we walk the line,	Your days are numbered, so are mine.
1	9184	18888	Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,	We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
1	9185	18889	City's just a jungle, more games to play,	Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
1	9186	18890	I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,	I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
1	9187	18891	Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,	Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
1	9188	18892	Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,	Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
1	9189	18893	All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime	Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
1	9190	18894	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
1	9191	18895	Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,	Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
1	9192	18896	I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,	I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
1	9193	18897	Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,	Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
1	9194	18898	So many things that we never will undo;	I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
1	9195	18899	Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,	Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
1	9196	18900	I need something strong to distract my mind,	I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
1	9197	18901	Well, I got here following the Southern Star,	I crossed that river just to be where you are.
1	9198	18902	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
1	9199	18903	Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,	I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
1	9200	18904	But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,	I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
1	9201	18905	Everybody moving  if they ain't already there,	Everybody got to move somewhere.
1	9202	18906	Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,	Things should start to get interesting right about now.
1	9203	18907	My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,	Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
1	9204	18908	I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,	So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
1	9205	18909	Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,	You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
1	9206	18910	Only one thing I did wrong,	Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
0	9207	18911	Summer days, summer nights are gone,	Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
1	9208	18912	I know a place where there's still something going on.	I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
1	9209	18913	I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,	I got a longhaired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
0	9210	18914	Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,	Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
1	9211	18915	Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.	Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
1	9212	18916	"The girls all say, ""You're a wornout star."""	My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
1	9213	18917	How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.	Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
1	9214	18918	The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.	What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
1	9215	18919	Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,	Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
1	9216	18920	What look good in the day at night is another thing.	She's looking into my eyes, she's aholding my hand,
1	9217	18921	She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,	"She say, ""You can't repeat the past."" I say, ""You can't? "
1	9218	18922	"What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."""	Where do you come from? Where do you go?
1	9219	18923	Sorry, that's anothing you would need to know.	Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
1	9220	18924	Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?	I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
1	9221	18925	Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,	I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
0	9222	18926	My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,	My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
1	9223	18927	I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.	You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
1	9224	18928	Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,	If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
1	9225	18929	Politician's got on his jogging shoes,	He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
1	9226	18930	He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,	You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
0	9227	18931	Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,	Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
1	9228	18932	I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.	Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
1	9229	18933	Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,	Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
0	9230	18934	Summer days, summer nights are gone,	Summer days, summer nights are gone,
1	9231	18935	By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,	Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
1	9232	18936	I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,	By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
1	9233	18937	I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,	Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
1	9234	18938	I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,	I'm painting the town, making my last goround.
1	9235	18939	Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,	I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
1	9236	18940	I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,	I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
1	9237	18941	That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,	I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
1	9238	18942	Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,	You were my first love and you will be my last.
1	9239	18943	Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.	Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
1	9240	18944	I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,	Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
0	9241	18945	Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,	Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
1	9242	18946	I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.	Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
1	9243	18947	They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,	When I left my longtime darling, she was standing in the door.
0	9244	18948	Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,	Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
1	9245	18949	My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.	Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
1	9246	18950	Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,	Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
0	9247	18951	Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,	Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
1	9248	18952	Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.	Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
1	9249	18953	I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,	Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
0	9250	18954	I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,	I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
1	9251	18955	He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.	Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
1	9252	18956	My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,	He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
0	9253	18957	Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,	Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
1	9254	18958	Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.	I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
1	9255	18959	I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,	I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
0	9256	18960	Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,	Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
1	9257	18961	Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays	Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
1	9258	18962	Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,	I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
1	9259	18963	I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,	From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
1	9260	18964	A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,	Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
1	9261	18965	Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,	Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
1	9262	18966	One of the boss's hangerson sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,	Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
1	9263	18967	There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,	Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
1	9264	18968	They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.	It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
1	9265	18969	My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.	I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
1	9266	18970	You can smell the pinewood burning, you can hear the schoolbell ring,	Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
1	9267	18971	"Romeo, he said to Juliet, ""You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."""	"Juliet said back to Romeo, ""Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"""
1	9268	18972	They got  all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.	They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
1	9269	18973	If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.	I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
1	9270	18974	My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,	My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
1	9271	18975	I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ringdancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,	I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
1	9272	18976	Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.	Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
1	9273	18977	High water rising, rising night and day,	All the gold and silver being stolen away,
1	9274	18978	Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,	He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
1	9275	18979	Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.	High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
1	9276	18980	Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.	Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
1	9277	18981	"Say ""You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"""	It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
1	9278	18982	I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hoppedup Mustang Ford,	Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
1	9279	18983	I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,	I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
1	9280	18984	Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.	High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
1	9281	18985	Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,	Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
1	9282	18986	"""Don't reach out for me,"" she said, ""Can't you see I'm drowning too?"""	It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
1	9283	18987	Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,	"""You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."""
1	9284	18988	They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,	"Judge says to the High Sheriff, ""I want him dead or alive."
1	9285	18989	"Either one, I don't care."" High water everywhere."	Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
1	9286	18990	I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.	"I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, ""Take it off the shelf."
1	9287	18991	"As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."""	I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
1	9288	18992	I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,	Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em alots of room.
1	9289	18993	Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,	I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
1	9290	18994	The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning	To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
1	9291	18995	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?	The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, blackeyed Susan,
1	9292	18996	The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
1	9293	18997	The air is thick and heavy all along the levee	Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
1	9294	18998	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?	Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
1	9295	18999	Yet I know when the time is right to strike.	I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
1	9296	19000	I know the kinds of things you like.	The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
1	9297	19001	The branches cast their shadows over stone.	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
1	9298	19002	The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,	The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
1	9299	19003	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?	The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
1	9300	19004	My tears keep flowing to the sea.	Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
1	9301	19005	For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.	My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
1	9302	19006	Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.	Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
1	9303	19007	Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,	Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
1	9304	19008	I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,	These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
1	9305	19009	Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,	Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
1	9306	19010	You don't understand it, my feeling for you.	You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
1	9307	19011	I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,	I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
1	9308	19012	The Siamese twins are coming to town,	People can't wait, they're gathered around.
1	9309	19013	When I left my home, the sky split open wide,	I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
1	9310	19014	You don't understand it, my feeling for you.	You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
1	9311	19015	My woman got a face like a teddy bear,	She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
1	9312	19016	The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,	I'm crashing my car trunkfirst into the board.
1	9313	19017	You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?	Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
1	9314	19018	You don't understand it, my feeling for you.	You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
1	9315	19019	Some things are too terrible to be true,	I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
1	9316	19020	Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,	I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
1	9317	19021	I'm stark naked, but I don't care,	I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
1	9318	19022	You don't understand it, my feeling for you.	You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
1	9319	19023	I'm here to create the new imperial empire,	I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
1	9320	19024	I care so much for you, didn't think I could,	I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
1	9321	19025	Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years	And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
1	9322	19026	You don't understand it, my feeling for you.	Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
1	9323	19027	"Man came to the door, I said, ""For whom are you looking?"""	"Says, ""Your wife."" I said, ""She's busy in the kitchen cooking."""
1	9324	19028	Poor boy, where you been?	I already told you, won't tell you again.
1	9325	19029	"I say, ""How much you want for that?"" I go into the store."	"Man says, ""Three dollars."" ""Alright,"" I say, ""will you take four?"""
1	9326	19030	Poor boy never say die,	Things will be alright by and by.
1	9327	19031	Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,	The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
1	9328	19032	Poor boy dressed in black,	Police at your back.
1	9329	19033	Poor boy in a redhot town	Out beyond the twinkling stars,
1	9330	19034	Riding firstclass train, making the round,	Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
1	9331	19035	"Othello told Desdemona, ""I'm cold, cover me with a blanket."	"By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"""
1	9332	19036	"She said, ""I gave it to you, drink it."""	Poor boy laying 'em straight,
1	9333	19037	Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.	Time and love has branded me with its claws,
1	9334	19038	Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.	"Poor boy in the hotel called the ""Palace of Gloom"","
1	9335	19039	"Call down to room service, says, ""Send up a room."""	My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
1	9336	19040	My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.	When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
1	9337	19041	He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.	All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
1	9338	19042	I don't know any more than this.	Poor boy picking up sticks,
1	9339	19043	Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.	"Knocking on the door, I say, ""Who is it? Where you from?"""
1	9340	19044	"Man said, ""Freddy."" I said, ""Freddy who?"" He said, ""Freddy or not, here I come."""	Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
1	9341	19045	Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,	Nasty, dirty, doublecrossing, backstabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
1	9342	19046	But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.	Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
1	9343	19047	I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,	Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
1	9344	19048	I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.	Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
1	9345	19049	Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,	But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
1	9346	19050	I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.	Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
1	9347	19051	Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,	It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
1	9348	19052	To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.	Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
1	9349	19053	I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,	Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
1	9350	19054	Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.	Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
1	9351	19055	Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,	I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
1	9352	19056	I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.	Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
1	9353	19057	Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,	I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
1	9354	19058	I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.	Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
1	9355	19059	I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,	I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
1	9356	19060	Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,	One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
1	9357	19061	Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,	You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
1	9358	19062	Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,	Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
1	9359	19063	I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.	Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
1	9360	19064	Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,	You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
1	9361	19065	The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,	You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
1	9362	19066	There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,	Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
1	9363	19067	Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,	You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
1	9364	19068	Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,	Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
1	9365	19069	Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,	Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
1	9366	19070	Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,	You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
1	9367	19071	Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,	You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
1	9368	19072	Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,	Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
1	9369	19073	Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,	You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
0	9370	19074	Throw my ticket in the wind.	Throw my mattress out there too.
1	9371	19075	Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand	That today I'll be staying here with you.
1	9372	19076	I could have left this town by noon,	By the night and been to some place new,
1	9373	19077	But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,	So today I'll be staying here with you.
1	9374	19078	Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.	Is it really any wonder,
1	9375	19079	The changes we put on each other's heads?	You came down on me like white thunder,
1	9376	19080	I left my dreams on the riverbed.	I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
1	9377	19081	I hear them semis rolling too.	If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
1	9378	19082	'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.	I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
1	9379	19083	I hear them semis rolling too.	If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
0	9380	19084	'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,	'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
1	9381	19085	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
1	9382	19086	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
1	9383	19087	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
0	9384	19088	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	9385	19089	Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
1	9386	19090	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
1	9387	19091	Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
0	9388	19092	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	9389	19093	Yes, and how many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
1	9390	19094	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
1	9391	19095	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
0	9392	19096	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	9393	19097	Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
1	9394	19098	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
1	9395	19099	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
1	9396	19100	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
1	9397	19101	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
1	9398	19102	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, they are achanging.
1	9399	19103	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
1	9400	19104	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.	The battle outside raging
1	9401	19105	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
1	9402	19106	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
1	9403	19107	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
1	9404	19108	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand	For the times, they are achanging.
1	9405	19109	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
1	9406	19110	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
1	9407	19111	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
1	9408	19112	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	9409	19113	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	9410	19114	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
1	9411	19115	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
1	9412	19116	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
1	9413	19117	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	9414	19118	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	9415	19119	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
1	9416	19120	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
0	9417	19121	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
1	9418	19122	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
1	9419	19123	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	9420	19124	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	9421	19125	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
1	9422	19126	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
1	9423	19127	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
1	9424	19128	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
1	9425	19129	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	9426	19130	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	9427	19131	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	9428	19132	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
1	9429	19133	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
1	9430	19134	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
1	9431	19135	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
1	9432	19136	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
1	9433	19137	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
1	9434	19138	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	9435	19139	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
1	9436	19140	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."
1	9437	19141	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out.
0	9438	19142	Now you don't talk so loud.	Now you don't seem so proud
1	9439	19143	About having to be scrounging your next meal.	How does it feel?
0	9440	19144	How does it feel	To be without a home,
0	9441	19145	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	9442	19146	Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
1	9443	19147	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
1	9444	19148	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
1	9445	19149	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
1	9446	19150	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
0	9447	19151	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	9448	19152	With no direction home,	A complete unknown,
1	9449	19153	Like a rolling stone?	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
1	9450	19154	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
1	9451	19155	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
1	9452	19156	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
1	9453	19157	He really wasn't where it's at	After he took from you everything he could steal?
0	9454	19158	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	9455	19159	To havebe on your own,	With no direction home,
0	9456	19160	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
1	9457	19161	Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
1	9458	19162	Exchanging all precious gifts,	But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
1	9459	19163	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
1	9460	19164	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
1	9461	19165	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	9462	19166	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	9463	19167	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	9464	19168	Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,	They'll stone you just like they said they would,
1	9465	19169	They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,	Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
1	9466	19170	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	9467	19171	Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,	They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
0	9468	19172	They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,	They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
1	9469	19173	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	9470	19174	They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,	They'll stone you when you are young and able,
1	9471	19175	They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,	"They'll stone you and then they'll say, ""Good luck."""
1	9472	19176	Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	9473	19177	Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,	Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
0	9474	19178	They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,	They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
1	9475	19179	Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	9476	19180	Alright!	Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
1	9477	19181	They'll stone you when you are walking home,	"They'll stone you and then say, ""You are brave,"""
1	9478	19182	They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.	But I would not feel so all alone,
1	9479	19183	"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."
1	9480	19184	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
1	9481	19185	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
1	9482	19186	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."""
1	9483	19187	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
1	9484	19188	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
0	9485	19189	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
1	9486	19190	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
1	9487	19191	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
1	9488	19192	Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but hishis hands are clean
1	9489	19193	And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
1	9490	19194	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it too.
1	9491	19195	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
1	9492	19196	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
1	9493	19197	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach for you in the night.
1	9494	19198	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
1	9495	19199	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	9496	19200	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	9497	19201	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	9498	19202	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
1	9499	19203	That long, black cloud is coming down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
0	9500	19204	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
0	9501	19205	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
1	9502	19206	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
1	9503	19207	Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
1	9504	19208	And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,	Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
1	9505	19209	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
1	9506	19210	I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.	We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
1	9507	19211	Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	She turned around to look at me as I was awalking away,
1	9508	19212	"I heard her say over my shoulder, ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
1	9509	19213	I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
1	9510	19214	So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,	Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
1	9511	19215	But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,	I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
1	9512	19216	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
1	9513	19217	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
1	9514	19218	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""Don't I know your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
1	9515	19219	I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
1	9516	19220	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
1	9517	19221	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
1	9518	19222	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
1	9519	19223	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
1	9520	19224	There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,	Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
1	9521	19225	She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,	And, when it finallythe bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
1	9522	19226	The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
1	9523	19227	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
1	9524	19228	Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
1	9525	19229	But me, I'm still on the road, aheading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
1	9526	19230	Pistolshots ring out in the barroom night,	Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
1	9527	19231	She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,	"Cries out, ""My God, they've killed 'em all!"""
1	9528	19232	"Here comes the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	9529	19233	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	9530	19234	Three bodies lying there does Patty see	And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
1	9531	19235	"""I didn't do it!"" he says and he throws up his hands,"	"""I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!"
1	9532	19236	"I saw them leaving,"" he says and he stops,"	"""One of us had better call up the cops."""
1	9533	19237	And so Patty calls the cops	And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
1	9534	19238	Meanwhile far away in another part of town,	Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
1	9535	19239	The number one contender for the middleweight crown	Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
1	9536	19240	When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road 	Just like the time before and the time before that.
1	9537	19241	In Paterson, that's just the way things go:	If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
1	9538	19242	Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,	Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
1	9539	19243	"He said, ""I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,"	"Jumped into a white car with outofstate plates."""
1	9540	19244	And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,	"Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"""
1	9541	19245	So they took him to the infirmary	And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
1	9542	19246	Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,	They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
1	9543	19247	The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,	"Said, ""Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"""
1	9544	19248	"Here's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
1	9545	19249	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
1	9546	19250	Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,	Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
1	9547	19251	While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game	And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
1	9548	19252	"""Remember that murder that youhappened in a bar?"	Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
1	9549	19253	Think you'd like to play ball with the law?	"Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."""
1	9550	19254	"Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure."""	"The cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break "
1	9551	19255	We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,	If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
1	9552	19256	You'll be doing society a favor,	That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver.
1	9553	19257	We wanna put his ass in the stir,	"We wanna pin this triple murder on him  he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."""
1	9554	19258	Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,	But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
1	9555	19259	"""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""and I do it for pay"	"And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"""
1	9556	19260	Up into some paradise	Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
1	9557	19261	And ride a horse along the trail,	But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
1	9558	19262	All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,	The trial was a pigcircus, he never had a chance:
1	9559	19263	The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,	To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
1	9560	19264	And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,	No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
1	9561	19265	And, though they could not produce the gun,	The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the allwhite jury agreed.
1	9562	19266	Rubin Carter was falsely tried,	The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
1	9563	19267	Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,	The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
1	9564	19268	How can the life of such a man	Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
1	9565	19269	To see him obviously framed	Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
1	9566	19270	Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties	Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
1	9567	19271	While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell,	An innocent man in a living hell.
1	9568	19272	"Yes, that's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	But it won't be over till they clear his name
1	9569	19273	And give him back the time he's done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.

1	9607	19311	Standing on the water, casting your bread	While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
1	9608	19312	Distant ships sailing in through the mist,	You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
1	9609	19313	Freedom, just around the corner for you,	But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
1	9610	19314	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9611	19315	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
1	9612	19316	You rise up and say goodbye to no one.	Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
1	9613	19317	Both of their futures so full of dread  you don't show one.	Shedding off one more layer of skin,
1	9614	19318	Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	9615	19319	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	9616	19320	You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,	Manipulator of crowds, you're a dreamtwister.
1	9617	19321	You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,	But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
1	9618	19322	Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,	You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
1	9619	19323	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9620	19324	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
1	9621	19325	The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.	In the smoke of the twilight, on a milkwhite steed,
1	9622	19326	Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.	Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
1	9623	19327	Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
1	9624	19328	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
1	9625	19329	Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,	Preacherman seeks the same  who'll get there first is uncertain.
1	9626	19330	Nightsticks and watercannons, tear gas, padlocks,	Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
1	9627	19331	Falsehearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,	Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
1	9628	19332	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9629	19333	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
1	9630	19334	A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.	He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
1	9631	19335	Take the motherless children off the street,	And place them at the feet of a harlot.
1	9632	19336	Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,	Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
1	9633	19337	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
1	9634	19338	Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,	It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
1	9635	19339	Feel like my soul has turned into steel,	I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
1	9636	19340	There's not even room enough to be anywhere,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9637	19341	Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,	Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
1	9638	19342	She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,	She put down in writing what was in her mind.
1	9639	19343	I just don't see why I should even care,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9640	19344	Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,	I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
1	9641	19345	I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,	I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
1	9642	19346	Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9643	19347	I was born here and I'll die here against my will,	I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
1	9644	19348	Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,	I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
1	9645	19349	Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,	It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
1	9646	19350	A worried man with a worried mind,	No one in front of me and nothing behind,
1	9647	19351	There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,	Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
1	9648	19352	I'm looking up into the sapphiretinted skies,	I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
1	9649	19353	Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,	Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
1	9650	19354	People are crazy, times are strange,	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
1	9651	19355	I used to care, but things have changed.	This place ain't doing me any good,
1	9652	19356	I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,	Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
1	9653	19357	Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,	Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
1	9654	19358	Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.	Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
1	9655	19359	Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.	People are crazy, times are strange,
1	9656	19360	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,	I used to care, but things have changed.
1	9657	19361	I've been walking forty miles of bad road,	If the bible is right, the world will explode,
1	9658	19362	I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.	Some things are too hot to touch,
1	9659	19363	The human mind can only stand so much,	You can't win with a losing hand.
1	9660	19364	Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,	Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street.
1	9661	19365	People are crazy, times are strange,	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
1	9662	19366	I used to care, but things have changed.	I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
1	9663	19367	You can hurt someone and not even know it,	The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
1	9664	19368	Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high,	All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
1	9665	19369	I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.	Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
1	9666	19370	I'm not that eager to make a mistake.	People are crazy, times are strange,
1	9667	19371	I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.	I used to care, but things have changed.
0	9668	19372	Summer days, summer nights are gone,	Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
1	9669	19373	I know a place where there's still something going on.	I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
1	9670	19374	I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,	I got a longhaired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
0	9671	19375	Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,	Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
1	9672	19376	Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.	Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
1	9673	19377	"The girls all say, ""You're a wornout star."""	My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
1	9674	19378	How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.	Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
1	9675	19379	The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.	What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
1	9676	19380	Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,	Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
1	9677	19381	What look good in the day at night is another thing.	She's looking into my eyes, she's aholding my hand,
1	9678	19382	She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,	"She say, ""You can't repeat the past."" I say, ""You can't? "
1	9679	19383	"What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."""	Where do you come from? Where do you go?
1	9680	19384	Sorry, that's anothing you would need to know.	Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
1	9681	19385	Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?	I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
1	9682	19386	Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,	I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
0	9683	19387	My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,	My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
1	9684	19388	I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.	You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
1	9685	19389	Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,	If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
1	9686	19390	Politician's got on his jogging shoes,	He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
1	9687	19391	He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,	You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
0	9688	19392	Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,	Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
1	9689	19393	I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.	Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
1	9690	19394	Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,	Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
0	9691	19395	Summer days, summer nights are gone,	Summer days, summer nights are gone,
1	9692	19396	I love you, pretty baby,	You're the only love I've ever known.
1	9693	19397	Just as long as you stay with me,	The whole world is my throne.
1	9694	19398	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing we can call our own
1	9695	19399	I'm moving after midnight	Down boulevards of broken cars,
1	9696	19400	Don't know what to do without it,	Without this love that we call ours.
1	9697	19401	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing but the moon and stars.
1	9698	19402	Down every street there's a window	And every window made of glass.
1	9699	19403	We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,	For as long as love will last.
1	9700	19404	Beyond here lies nothing	But the mountains of the past.
1	9701	19405	My ship is in the harbor	And the sails are spread.
1	9702	19406	Listen to me, pretty baby,	Lay your hand upon my head.
1	9703	19407	Beyond here lies nothing,	Nothing done and nothing said.
