[Intro: Charli XCX]
I'll be your femmebot

Go fuck your prototype
I'm an upgrade of your stereotype
Don't come with a guarantee

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I feel the sparks between us
Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you mess it up
I'll self-destruct

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit
You make me lose control
It's automatic
You push my buttons
See-e-e-e how I work it
I-I-I-I get what I want
Like it or not

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I-I get what I want

I got you hypnotized (hypnotized)
I read your thoughts when you look in my eyes
You're just my human toy (human toy)
And I am programmed to search and destroy

[Pre-Chorus: Dorian Electra]
I feel the sparks between us
Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you F it up (five, four, three)
I'll self-destruct (two, one)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit
You make me lose control

[Verse 3: Mykki Blanco]
Ghost in a shell
I'm a beast in the sheets
I'm a neutron bomb-bomb, blowin' the beat
Gonna spray that raygun and fall to his knees
I'm a lightnin' rod, I'ma bite that bod
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Slut-bot, fuck no, systems down
Boy, I'll clone you, boy, I'll swerve you
Glitch your mainframe, now I own you
Ex Machina-na-na, you can't win
I'm A.I. fly, I am that bitch
Is your love for real though?
I'm Trinity, you're Neo
I'm bionic, not ironic
Super Saiyan, supersonic
Hard drive crash, you don't remember
Charli bit yo wittle finga

[Bridge: Dorian Electra]
I'll be your femmebot
Girl, I'll be your femmebot, can never turn me off
I'll be, I'll be your femme-

Some say my fire burns way too high
Some say they find me too hot to touch
But I, I think it's not enough

[Pre-Chorus]

I entertain until it's time to go
You know I like to put it on display

I do it big and take up lots of space
You know I like to get up in your face

Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
You know I like it loud

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, there was the word
In nothing but darkness, God made the world
In the beginning, there were just two
Made from the dust, like all of us
In the beginning, the four letter word:
"L-O-V-E" meant nothing to me
But made in his image, we were born
Two of a kind, beginning of time

[Chorus]
And God made me
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And he loves me, and he loves me
And God made me, and God made me
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me, just like Adam and Steve
And he loves me, 'cause God made me

[Verse 2]
And in the garden, they were both there
Smiling like children without a care
And in the garden, up on the tree
They saw the fruit for you and me
And in the garden, they took a bite
Ashamed of the truth, ashamed of the light
Cast into darkness, they would be damned
For being a man holding hands

[Chorus]
And God made me
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And he loves me, and he loves me
And God made me, and God made me
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me, just like Adam and Steve
And he loves me, 'cause God made me

[Bridge]
They want to destroy me, they will all enjoy it
Say I'm an abomination, but I'm God's creation
They all want to crush me, say I am so disgusting
Secretly they love me, just like him

[Chorus]
And God made me
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made my this way
And he loves me, and he loves me
God made me gay
And he loves me, 'cause God made me[Intro]

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
(Drag) You can create who you are
(Drag) Gender-bending is just the start
(Drag) You dress to impress, to express who you are
You are a superstar

[Verse 1: Imp Queen]
Come on queens, let's get ancient
Back, back, back in the Grecian Age
When only boys were allowed on stage
A Masc4Masc society, no room for femininity
So I'll play the girl, and you play the boy
Then we can go play with each other, daddy

[Verse 2: Lucy Stoole]
D-R-A-G, it started with Shakespeare and me
Wherefore art thou all you ladies?
Not on stage, for it's degrading!
Theater is much too crass for the dainty, wilting lass!
Only queens are allowed on stage
And even then, we don't make the same wage

[Verse 3: Eva Young]
Painted, polished; yeah, I'm flawless
All you boys bow down
I'm the Chinese prima donna
Don't you wanna kiss the crown?
Use my sword and use my spear, that's how I look this real
You better fear my strength and skill, my looks can kill

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
(Drag) You can create who you are
(Drag) Gender-bending is just the start
(Drag) You dress to impress, to express who you are
You are a superstar

[Verse 4: Dorian Electra]
Step right up, see the freaks on the stage
It's the the sideshow craze of the Victorian age
Gender non-conformers forced to be circus performers
People came to pay to see them put on display

[Verse 5: The Vixen]
Mm, liquor up, lick her down, she delicious
The Vixen, but I never been a mistress
The mission is to end the prohibition
Me and the boys got a pleasure doin' business
Fat cats got ya sleeping with the fishes
Real tea, it ain't Lipton I'm sippin'
Speakeasy and listen, there's no intermission
The coppers be trippin', the trouble we get in
The misfits we let in, the bets we be bettin'
The thirst I be quenchin', the whistles we wettin'
All the hate and debate got us pausin'
So we dress like we livin' in the closet
All the queens, and the kings, and the clowns
Show the upper class how to get down (town)
All the down low boys stand up
Here's a chance for you to step, touch
Bad girl giving you a good time
Never a bad time to pass the moonshine
I get around 'cause I run this town
They locked liquor up, come lick her down

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
(Drag) You can create who you are
(Drag) Gender-bending is just the start
(Drag) You dress to impress, to express who you are
You are a superstar

[Verse 6: London Jade]
Uh
Been a minute, lately I've been feeling pissed off
Tell the cops they could really get flipped off
I'm not the girl you should ever try to criss-cross
Can't arrest me for the clothes I got stitched on (What?)
Catch this, I was chilling with my drag sis
Trans girl so you know I look mad fish
I don't cross-dress, what's with the madness?
Real woman, bet you really wanna tap this
Sassy, please do not touch or grab me
Unless you wanna see some bottle smashing
It's my body, my choice, my hobby, my voice
What's the big deal if I got a sugar daddy?
Trans power, dance louder
Clap your hands, don't stop, don't miss
Start a riot, bop your fists
I hit the club, who stoppin' this?
All the girls, we on our way
Clear the skies, we done with shade (We done)
Live your life and celebrate
Now let's get high and levitate

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
(Drag) Create yourself on the stage
(Drag) Gender is a game, but the rules have got to change
(Drag) Transcend it and blend it and bend till it breaks
You are what you create
(Drag) You can create who you are
(Drag) Gender-bending is just the start
(Drag) You dress to impress, to express who you are
You are a superstar
(Drag, drag, drag, drag, drag, drag)

Little nigga, please, I ain't your mom
Ain't nobody want a fuckin' loser
Oh, you wanna use my Uber
Oh, you think you're bein' cute? Shoo!

[Verse 3: Hannah Diamond]
I can't forget you forgot about me
Moved on so fast, I felt stuck in last week
Falling apart, now you've broken my heart
Let's hit rewind, let's go back to the start
Flashbacks of feelings, I don't want to feel
Can't stop believing that it wasn't real
You're stuck in my mind, preserved in my phone
Get out of my head, I, I want you to go

[Verse 4: Dorian Electra]
Out of my head, I feel like I'm possessed
Gotta get me out of this prison, I need an exorcism
Ooh, you're like a demon, and you've got me screamin' (Get out!)
Bang my head against the wall, but did you get away from it all?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Dorian Electra, Hannah Diamond & Mykki Blanco]
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head

Everybody coming at me, they wanna attack me
They wanna wipe me clean
They can make me cry, but they can't make me bleed
Masc for mascara, the feeling of terror
As they watch these tears rolling down
Rolling down, they can't stop me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a guy, don't be surprised
If I take my time to glamorize
No reason why that I can't try
To line my eyes, it feels so right

[Outro]
Guyliner
Yeah, you know I'm wearing
Guyliner
I'm wearing, nobody can stop me now
Guyliner
This is the real me, baby
And this ain't no disguise
Guyliner, yeah
Guyliner, ooh-ooh, I'm wearing
Guyliner (Guyliner)
Guyliner, under my eyes
Guyliner, it feels so right

If you live by the sword
You’ll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword

[Verse 2]
It's cold like the ocean, cold like the rain
Show your devotion, show me the pain
Show me the blood, show me you tried
Show me the tears coming down from your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Live by the sword, you die by the sword, oh-oh
’Cause I'll get what's mine, baby
You'll get what's yours

[Chorus]
You'll get what's yours

You wanna hit like this?

You wanna live like this?

If you live by the sword

If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword

[Intro]
Freaky, freaky, freaky for life

[Verse 1]
I'm so uptight, my head, it ain’t right
It's spinning, baby, spinning around
You know that I need some freak therapy
So let's freak out and spread it around
I like to be in the spotlight
Step on the scene ’cause it feels right
I freakin' scream, baby, all night
I do it, I do it, do it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
They just don't understand me
I'm not like them, I'm freaky

[Chorus]
Freaky, I want you to get freaky (Ooh-ooh)
You gotta get freaky (Ooh)
Freaky, freaky, freaky for life

[Verse 2]
My little brain, it isn't the same
I told you I'm not the normal type
Normal like you, not something I do
Even as hard as I try
Listen to me, it's the way now
You got to believe, what I say now
Let your freak flag fly every day now
Not taking, not taking, not taking it down

[Pre-Chorus]
They just don’t understand me
’Cause I'm so freakin’ random

[Chorus]
Freaky, I want you to get freaky (Ooh-ooh)
You gotta get freaky (Ooh)
Freaky (You know just what I like)
Freaky
(You know I'm super freaky)
Freaky, freaky, freaky alright

[Bridge]
I hear what they call me
I hear what they say
I'm not very cool, yeah
But I'll never change
I’ll stick to my guns
Then throw them away
I'm a freak forever
From my cradle to my grave
Freak forever, grave
Freak forever

[Outro]
Freaky, I want you to get freaky (Ooh-ooh)
You gotta get freaky (Ooh)
Freaky, freaky, freaky for life

[Intro]
The clitoris
The clitoris

[Chorus]
The clitoris
It's been a mystery
The clitoris
It's my anatomy, ooh
The clitoris
Much more than you can see
And if you get to know it, you can get to know me
Yeah

[Verse 1]
In the days of old man's form on pedestals
But girls, less than ideal
We were not taught to feel
And then into the Dark Ages when witch hunts were all the rage
The key to see if she's a witch or not lies right between her legs
So if you see the mark of Satan then you know there's no mistakin'
She's been taken by desire, throw her on the fire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fear inside
Pandora's box, opening wide, ooh
The sinful seat of delight
Earthly pleasures hidden far out of sight

[Chorus]
The clitoris
It's been a mystery
The clitoris
It's my anatomy, ooh
The clitoris
Much more than you can see
And if you get to know it, you can get to know me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Learned men of science, still some would deny it
(They would deny it)
Anatomists' dissections weren't enough for them to buy it
(They would deny it)
The few who did uncover it
Would argue who discovered it
This excavated treasure, the source of woman's pleasure
Then, Dr. Freud came along
Told me I was doing it all wrong
I need to graduate the way I masturbate
From the clitoral to the vaginal

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did he know (did he know)
What goes on inside that hole? Oh no
'Cause he couldn't see (couldn't see)
All stimulation happens clitorally

[Bridge]
They say I'm frigid and cold and I need to be controlled
That I'm too hot, demented, disordered, hysterical
Or that I'm crazy or lazy, too mild or wild, and baby
They get to decide what's natural and factual
Even doctor's textbooks, yes, they would forget it
The clit they would omit and really not even regret it
So scientists set out, to find out all about
This old orgasmic mystery and settle any doubt

[Pre-Chorus 3]
In 3D
The clit was mapped architecturally
To the world's surprise
It was found to be ten times its size

[Chorus]
The clitoris
Shouldn't be a mystery (shouldn't be a mystery)
The clitoris
It's my anatomy (it's my anatomy)
Ooh, the clitoris
Much more than you can see
And if you get to know it, you can get to know me
(Get to know me)

[Outro]
We can come to understand (understand)
Worlds of pleasure in our hand (in our hand)
Study up and come with me (come with me)
The clitoris will be set free

/x/

[Verse 1: Zuri Marley]
Never trust a demon told a father to his son
A woman is a devil unless she is a nun
Controls her body with her herbs
The church call this a witch's curse
Her power makes them feel disturbed
They tie her up and watch her burn

[Verse 2: Dorian Electra]
Good girls stay at home, don't go out to work or vote
Womanhood is on the brink, motherhood going extinct
Midwives are to blame, flushing babies down the drain
Plus they hurt our profit gain; stop these women, they're insane

[Pre-Chorus: Dorian Electra & Zuri Marley]
They try to shut us up and shut us down
Try to start a fire, burn us to the ground
Don't try to control what belongs to me
Get your hands, get your hands off my body

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
Control (control), get your hands off my body
Control (control), taking it back tonight
Control (control), no more control, just let it go
Control, get your hands off my body

[Verse 3: K Rizz]
Anti-abortion, anti-immigration
Joined forces against foreign races
They feared foreign overpopulation (huh)
Want white folks to keep procreatin'
Whatchu scared of? Something lil' spicy?
Genetically inferior, huh? Bite me!
Tube tying, folks just like me
So baby now we got bad blood, fight me

[Verse 4: Chynna]
First off, I don't like needles
Neither do my people, never seen as equal
Sterilize my women, not a question of permission
But a lesson in the art of stealin' anything they need to
Women in the slave trade, all of 'em were "fair game"
"Born to be a temptress", said that nature was the main blame
Never had an option before they got the test done
Testin' their eugenics on my women, we the test run
But where they get thought from? (thought from)
Hitler only the beginner, guess who taught him?
California been a sinner, Google it
It's been proven U.S. movin' like a hypocrite

[Pre-Chorus: K Rizz & Chynna]
Uh, they talkin' 'bout "dirty genes"
Acting like the blood on their hands is clean
The science was baseless, the premise was racist
Get your hands, get your hands off my body

[Chorus: Dorian Electra, Chynna & K Rizz]
Control (control), get your hands up off my body (get it off)
Control (control), taking it back tonight (that's right)
Control (control, no control), no more control, no no just let it go (let it go, uh, uh)
Get your hands, get your hands off my body

[Verse 5: London Jade]
Yeah, I got the body of a goddess (goddess)
Even though your religion didn't want this (want this)
Yeah, I'm the witch, I'm the shaman (shaman)
They wanna hate me 'cause my body isn't common
Woah, you wanna place my gender?
And then you wanna shame me, wanna blame my temper?
Society will tell you that I'm playin' dress up
But I'm natural, I can make you feel the pressure, uh
And don't try to overpower my spirit, my mind, my soul, and my flower
Open up your mind, maybe you will understand
Trans doesn't focus on the parts up in my pants
So don't control my body with science
'Cause me and my girls will form an alliance
Pussy don't purr when you messin' with the lions
Coming for you quick and we 'bout to start a riot

[Bridge: Zuri Marley]
Differences in our experience, are you listening?
Don't stay quiet when they erase our images
You blow yourself a kiss. Are you a “feminist?”
Hold me, hold me, hold me, but don't try to control me

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
Control (hey hey), oh get your hands off my body
Control (control) taking it back tonight
No more control, no no, just let it go
(No more control, no no, no more control, no no, yeah)
Control (control), get your hands off my body
Control (control), we're takin' it back tonight
Control (control), no control, just let it go
Get your hands, get your hands off my body

Random circumstance

All life on earth, an accident
No gods or saviors just odds in your favor
So don’t stop, so don’t stop
Till you hit the jackpot

To step into my heart, to step into my arms
You get only one shot, to step into the stars

Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

I'm a little freaky but I'm very nice (I'm very nice)

[Chorus]
High heels, so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can't deny
High heels, so high

[Verse 1]
It started with the Persian cavalry
Admired by the French aristocracy
They wore high heels in the heat of war
The trend spread to the palace floor
Far removed from practicality
High heels were the height of masculinity
Worn by King Louis the fourteenth
Higher than his kingdom had ever seen

[Chorus]
High heels, so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can’t deny
High heels, so high

[Verse 2]
Who could forget Marie Antoinette?
Excess without a single regret
So high with her feet up at Versailles
Meanwhile, leaving her people to die
High heels, unfashionable
"Just like women, irrational"
Monarchy is so last season
The feet of the elite smell like treason

[Chorus]
High heels, so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can’t deny
High heels, so high

[Verse 3]
High heels were out of style
At least for a while
Women in pants, women on wheels
It's hard to march in high heels
Regrettably, pornography brought back high heels for eternity
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
High heels accentuate a woman's curves
So exotic, made erotic
Forever and ever

[Chorus]
High heels, so high
We suffer for fashion, but why?
They've got a power you can’t deny
High heels, so high
High heels, so high
Break through that ceiling, it's time
We've got the power to decide
High heels, so high

[Outro]
High heels
Who says they're only for women?
The future of high heels is only beginning
Feminine and gentlemen, we're all walking around in them
High heels, so high

/x/

[Verse 1]
I know your secret
You can't conceal it
What you desire
I felt the flames getting higher and higher

[Pre-Chorus]
No, this lie can't last for long
I know what turns you on
So baby‚ take it off
This war has begun

[Chorus]
Under the armor‚ you're getting hotter and hotter
Under the armor‚ you're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter

[Verse 2]
'Cause I can see you hide behind your shield
It's so clear to me you feel the way I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
No, this lie can't last for long
I know what turns you on
So baby‚ take it off
This war has begun

[Chorus]
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter‚ and hotter
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter

[Bridge]
But you push me farther away
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter
But you push me farther away
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter
But you push me farther away
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter
But you push me farther away

[Outro]
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter (So, so hot)
Under the armor, you're getting hotter and hotter (So hot)
And hotter, and hotter
You're getting hotter and hotter
And hotter, and hotter

[Pre-Chorus: Ravenna Golden]
Well, I guess it's morning again
'Cause I just fell out of my bed
Waking up from a dream that I had
I can hear your voice in my head

[Chorus: Ravenna Golden]
And I feel the lights turning on
Open my eyes and you're gone
Open my eyes and you're gone
Open my eyes and you're gone
(open my eyes and you're gone)

[Verse 1: Ravenna Golden]
Staring at me through the frosted glass door
Hard to see me when you can't stand too close
Throwing bottles in the yard making noise
Light is bright so I covered my eyes

Breaking
Down like it's a hobby
Laying face down
Please don't try to stop me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I guess it's morning again
'Cause I just fell out of my bed
Waking up from a dream that I had
I can hear your voice in my head

[Chorus: Ravenna Golden]
And I feel the lights turning on
Open my eyes and you're gone
Open my eyes and you're gone
Open my eyes and you're gone
(open my eyes and you're gone)

[Verse 2: Dorian Electra]
Staring at you through a cracked dirty screen
Hard to hear you when it's not what I mean
Up the volume so you can't hear the noise (yeah!)
Turn the brightness down and cover your eyes
Lying
To myself and you, I can't stop trying
Please don't tell me to (no)

[Pre-Chorus: Ravenna Golden, Dorian Electra]
Well, I guess it's morning again
'Cause I just fell out of my bed
Waking up from a dream that I had
I can hear your voice in my head

[Chorus: Ravenna Golden & Dorian Electra]
And I feel the lights turning on
Open my eyes and you're gone
(and you're gone, and you're gone)
Open my eyes and you're gone
Open my eyes and you're gone
(open my eyes and you're gone)

/x/

[Verse 1]
Expensive song
Expensive gear
Top of the line
Can't you hear
I got the best DJs in the world
Working for me, have you heard?
That smell cost a hundred jean
Not cheap, not cheap
It isn't fair, pricey
Too pricey for you and me
It's so expensive, oh

[Chorus]
It's so expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive, expensive
So expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive, oh
It's so expensive
I can't, I can't
I cannot fully spend that
So expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive

[Verse 2]
Expensive tastes, expensive sounds
I like to keep expensive things around
Expensive boys, expensive girls
We live in an expensive world
The top team, the industry
Not for me, not cheap
It isn't free spending weeks
No sleep, it's constantly
It's so expensive, oh

[Chorus]
It's so expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive, expensive
So expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive, oh
It's so expensive
I can't, I can't
I cannot fully spend that
So expensive, oh, oh, oh
So expensive

/x/

[Verse 1]
Drive around your town at midnight
With those big Texas stars burning so bright
I start to wonder what you're up to to-to-tonight
Wanna go for a ride, baby stay by my side
All night

So jump in my truck, I'll take you for a ride
Nothing naughty just to see the country side

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget to buckle up, now, baby
It might get a little bumpy baby
Best ride
Best ride of your--

We could get a little freaky baby
Have to be a little sneaky baby
Just might be
The best ride of your life
Just might be
The best ride of your life

‘Til we run out of gas on the dirt road
Baby, you can throw your past out the window

[Bridge]
The best ride of your life
Oh, honey
Ooh
Sit next to me honey
Buckle up now
The best ride
The best ride

Oh take a ride with me
Take a ride tonight
Take a ride with me
Don’t be shy

/x/

[Chorus]
What Mary Didn’t Know
What Mary didn’t know
Didn’t know, she did not know
She was a little girl
In a black and white world
She didn’t know, didn’t know

[Verse 1]
Mary took a look inside of my head
Saw me looking at the color red
Saw how my eyes worked, how they linked to my brain
Yeah she could see it but was it the same?

Mary’d never seen color herself
Just read descriptions in her books on the shelf
Thought she knew all about the ways that we see
But was it the same for me?

[Chorus]
What Mary Didn’t Know
What Mary didn’t know
Didn’t know, she did not know
She was a little girl
In a black and white world
She didn’t know, didn’t know

[Verse 2]

Mary sweet thing didn’t realize
The world around her yeah, with her own eyes
Was there more to sight than words could tell?
She could explain it very well

[Chorus]
What Mary Didn’t Know
What Mary didn’t know
Didn’t know, she did not know
She was a little girl
In a black and white world
She didn’t know, didn’t know

[Verse 3]
One day Mary left her room behind
Opened her eyes and opened her mind
And she was shocked by the things that she saw
The world of color well it left her in awe
Mary, Mary with your jaw on the floor
Mary, Mary thought you knew it all, knew it all

[Chorus]
What Mary Didn’t Know
What Mary didn’t know
Didn’t know, she did not know
She was a little girl
In a black and white world
She didn’t know, didn’t know

/x/

[Verse 1]
There ain’t nothin in the mind
Which ain’t been in the sensations
Let me take you on a sensation vacation
Through sense experience, the mind is created
As well as rules to process raw sense data

For Empiricists, yeah this is the word
Tabula Rasa, a blank slate to the world
When we are born there are no thoughts in our mind
But through experience, they’re built up over time

[Chorus]
It’s all sensual
{sensual, sensual}
It’s all sensual

[Verse 2]
But for the Rationalists who do believe
That the precious senses only deceive
They say the source of truth about the world outside
Is human reason, inside your mind

Must not succumb (un-uh) to sensual seduction
Must overcome (yeah) through rational deduction
Locked up in logic in the search for what’s real
Cut off from their senses, they forget how to feel

[Chorus]
They say it’s not sensual
Try to deny the sensual
(And say it’s all rational)

[Verse 3]
You say “I think, therefore I exist”
The one and only certain truth you insist
Distrust your senses, all you know to be true
Is that you can’t deny the thinking mind, of me and of you

Is it really all so sensual?
Is it really all so sensual?
Is it really all so sensual?
Is it really all so sensual?

Can you justify? (your beliefs)
Can you testify? To the sensory?
Can you justify? (your beliefs)
Can you testify? To the sensory?

[Verse 4: Baba Brinkman]
Hey, Rationalism is on top
'Cause lately Empiricism has gone Pop
There ain't no Tabula Rasa, John Locke
Better check your senses against logic, non-stop
No conspiracy, lyrically, I empirically expose the heresy in Empiricism fearlessly
It's mathematical, not magical
Radical sense data on its own is just not rational
Ask a developmental psychologist
Descartes was right, we have innate knowledges

Not Platonic forms like Plato thought it was
Darwin explains how they became part of us
The brain is too complicated for Blank-Slatists
Organized in advance of experience, baby
And that's a priori, so a posteriori can kiss my posterior, alright?

Some things the senses cannot perceive
Sometimes reason can not take you where it’s trying to lead
They both have limits baby soon you will see
How it all comes down to somewhere in between

[Chorus]
They say it’s not sensual
Try to deny the sensual
(And say it’s all rational)

/x/

[Verse 1]
Mr. Kurzweil please stay for a while
Singularity's near, we’re only watching the clock
Hoping for the best but expecting robots
Are they gonna kill us all or not?
Don't let me die young I want to live forever
My body is fragile so replace it with metal
Living as a cyborg, I'll be on a God-trip
It’s all about transcendence

Our bodies and computers will be as one
Superintelligence will be such fun!
Thanks to our leader we'll always be new
With brains wired to self improve

[Chorus]
Forever young
I want to be forever young
With Ray I want to live forever
Forever, and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Yes I really want to live forever
Forever young

[Verse 2]
Some are just downers, some refuse to see
Some won't transcend their biology
Sooner or later they all will be gone
While my guy stays young
It's so hard to get old, I'd rather not
I'll never perish with my nanobots
Me and Ray we're enlightened ones
And we'll evolve together

Uploading our consciousness before death
Saved in the cloud to be born again
So many dreams comin’ out of the blue
They all will come true!

[Chorus]
Forever young
I want to be forever young
With Ray I’m gonna live forever
Forever, and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Yes I really want to live forever
Forever, and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young!
I'm gonna sing this song forever!

/x/

[Verse 1]
Hey there Freidrich Hayek, ya lookin' really nice
Your methodology is oh so precise
You break down social science to the fundamentals
Rules and social order are the essentials

[Chorus]
The use of knowledge in society
By each of us, we make the economy
It's not magic that somehow our plans all align
The result of human action, not of human design

[Verse 2]
Tell me your thoughts on resource misallocation
Distorted price signals and misinformation
Interest rates that are made artificially low
Telling producers where resources should go

[Chorus]
The use of knowledge in society
By each of us, we make the economy
It's not magic that somehow our plans all align
The result of human action, not of human design

[Verse 3]
Since these low interest rates, like you said, are lies
Malinvestments come as no surprise
Soon these mistakes will all be revealed
And then corrected, unless they're concealed

[Bridge]
Sometimes I dream all day 'bout bein' Mrs. Hayek
We'd share milkshakes, watch sunsets, and kayak
We'd work together on that business cycle theory
Oh, darlin', you've been workin' hard, you must be weary
Come to my couch, on which you can rest
I'll make tea, and we'll talk credit and interest
Then I can talk about my interest in you
Of course we'll talk 'bout the economy, too

[Outro]
Just me and you
Just me and you
Me and you
Oh, oh
Me and you

/x/

[Verse 1]
Somebody locked me in a room
Chinese messages comin’ through
I had to respond, but did not understand
So I just followed a list of commands

[Chorus]
I’m living in a Chinese room
I’m speaking Chinese to you
I’m living a Chinese room
(But) What it means, I GOT NO CLUE! (HEY!)

[Verse 2]
I’m following a set of rules
That tell me which Chinese symbols to use
They’re talking to me, they’re speaking Chinese
And they think I understand what it means!

[Chorus]
I’m living in a Chinese room
I’m speaking Chinese to you
I’m living a Chinese room
(But) What it means, I GOT NO CLUE! (HEY!)

[Verse 3]
And I think I fooled them all
That I’m a native Chinese speaker and all
Did my best, passed the Turing Test
Gave the proper response to every request

[Chorus]
I’m living in a Chinese room
I’m speaking Chinese to you
I’m living a Chinese room
(But) What it means, I GOT NO CLUE! (HEY!)

/x/

[Verse 1]
Our life
Like a dream
Step on stage, and then the girlies scream
This world
Unreal
Just like a simulated fantasy

Parties crazy
Memory is hazy
Flash before me every once in a while
Do I remember?
A dark night in November
White lab coat and a bright white light…

[Chorus]
Brain in a vat
I'm just a brain in a vat
Brain in a vat, brain in a vat, oh yeah
I'm just a brain a vat

[Verse 2]
Mad doctor
Brain robber
Stole our brains, & tied up in his lab
His scheme
Big machine
Programmed to stimulate our brains in a vat
Electric shocks
Sparks fire
Our neurons linked up to a billion live wires
They trigger
Sensations
It’s all a hallucination!

[Chorus]
Brain in a vat
I'm just a brain in a vat
Brain in a vat, brain in a vat, oh yeah
I'm just a brain a vat

[Verse 3]
My brain
Detained
Chained up in a jar, kept alive
My mind
Confined
Isolated from the world outside
But I was walking and I was talking
And we were rockin', in the city tonight
While we were dreamin', a little Evil Demon
Kept us prisoner in his world of lies!

[Bridge]
In our vats we were kings of the world
Everything. Money and girls
In our vats we could get what we want
Big hair, endless croissants
Who cares, if it’s all a sham
I just want to live in my fantasy land!

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Brain in a vat
I'm just a brain in a vat
Brain in a vat, brain in a vat, oh yeah
I'm just a brain a vat

/x/

[Verse 1]
They tell me time is an illusion but I'll never let it go
Stuck in this delusion but I’ll try to take it slow
To organize the world the way it has to be
The framework of my insides I let go and let it be

[Chorus]
Time's real
You know how it feels
(Time's real)
But what does it mean?
(Time’s real)
The way that it seems

[Verse 2]
I trained myself to feel by the ticking of the clock
Tick tock tick tock and it never stops
And when I'm walking with you right before my knees collapse
It feels a frozen moment don't know how time has elapsed

It used to take me hours just to do a simple task
Everlasting showers spending days long in the bath
I couldn't count the minutes 1 to 2 or 33
Rock operas on the toilet, relax and let it be

[Chorus]
Time's real
You know how it feels
(Time's real)
But what does it mean?
(Time's real)
The way that it seems

[Bridge]
And when I'm with you time goes fast
Clock telling me time has passed
How to make this moment last?
“Do you have the time?” You asked

[Chorus]
Time’s real
You know how it feels
(Time’s real)
But what does it mean?
(Time's real)
The way that it seems

/x/
