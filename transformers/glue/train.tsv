0	0	9704	Well, I don't know why I love you like I do 	Nobody in the world can get along with you.
0	1	9705	You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den 	I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
0	2	9706	Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be	When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
0	3	9707	Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,	And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
0	4	9708	I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,	I helped you when you had no food to eat.
0	5	9709	You're the kind of woman I just don't understand 	You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
0	6	9710	Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,	You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
1	7	9711	You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,	You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
0	8	9712	Rambling outta the Wild West,	Leaving the towns I love the best,
0	9	9713	Thought I'd seen some ups and downs	Till I come into New York town:
1	10	9714	People going down to the ground,	Buildings going up to the sky.
0	11	9715	Wintertime in New York town,	The wind blowing the snow around,
0	12	9716	Walk around with nowhere to go,	Somebody could freeze right to the bone 
0	13	9717	I froze right to the bone.	New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years 
1	14	9718	I didn't feel so cold then.	I swung on to my old guitar,
0	15	9719	Grabbed hold of a subway car,	And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
0	16	9720	I landed up on the downtown side,	Greenwich Village.
0	17	9721	I walked down there and ended up	In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
0	18	9722	I'd get on the stage and sing and play,	"Man there said, ""Come back some other day."
0	19	9723	You sound like a hillbilly.	"We want folksingers here."""
0	20	9724	Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,	Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
0	21	9725	I blowed inside out and upside down,	The man there said he loved my sound,
0	22	9726	He was raving about how he loved my sound 	Dollar a day's worth.
0	23	9727	Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,	I finally got a job in New York town.
0	24	9728	In a bigger place, bigger money too,	Even joined a union, paid my dues.
0	25	9729	Now, a very great man once said	That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
0	26	9730	It don't take too long to find out	Just what he was talking about.
0	27	9731	A lot of people don't have much food on their table,	But they got a lot of forks and knives 
0	28	9732	And they gotta cut something.	So, one morning when the sun was warm
0	29	9733	I rambled out of New York town,	Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
0	30	9734	Headed out for the western skies.	So long, New York!
0	31	9735	Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.	All I want for you to do is take my body home,
1	32	9736	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,	Well, well, well,
0	33	9737	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,	Jesus gonna make upJesus gonna make up
0	34	9738	Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.	Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
0	35	9739	Meet me in the middle of the air.	If these wings should fail me, Lord,
0	36	9740	Won't you meet me with another pair?	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
1	37	9741	Well, well, well,	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
1	38	9742	Jesus gonna make upJesus gonna make up	Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
0	39	9743	Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.	All I want you to do is take me when I die,
1	40	9744	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,	Well, well, well,
0	41	9745	Well, well, well, so I can die easy,	Jesus gonna make upJesus gonna make up
0	42	9746	I am a man of constant sorrow,	I've seen trouble all my days.
0	43	9747	I'll say goodbye to Colorado,	Where I was born and partly raised.
0	44	9748	Your mother says I'm a stranger,	My face you'll never see no more.
0	45	9749	But there's one promise, darling:	I'll see you on God's golden shore.
0	46	9750	Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,	Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
0	47	9751	I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.	Perhaps I'll die on that train.
0	48	9752	I'm going back to Colorado,	The place that I started from.
0	49	9753	If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,	Honey, I never would have come.
0	50	9754	Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,	I believe I'm fixing to die.
0	51	9755	Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,	I believe I'm fixing to die.
0	52	9756	Well, I don't mind dying,	But I hate to leave my children crying.
1	53	9757	Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!	Look over yonder to that burying ground!
0	54	9758	Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.	Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
0	55	9759	I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.	Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
1	56	9760	I believe I'm fixing to die.	Well, I don't mind dying,
0	57	9761	But I hate to leave my children crying.	There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
0	58	9762	It's rising up above my head, up above my head.	Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
0	59	9763	It's rising up above my head,	And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
0	60	9764	Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,	I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
0	61	9765	Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,	I believe I'm fixing to die,
0	62	9766	Fixing to die, fixing to die.	Well, I don't mind dying,
0	63	9767	I've been around this whole country,	But I never yet found Fennario.
1	64	9768	Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,	Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
0	65	9769	Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.	Her name that she had was Pretty PeggyO.
0	66	9770	Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,	What will your mother say, Pretty PeggyO?
0	67	9771	What will your mother say to know you're going away,	You're never, never, never coming backiO?

0	70	9774	The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,	The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty PeggyO!
0	71	9775	The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.	He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.

0	73	9777	Well, our captain, he is dead  died for a maid.	He's buried somewheres in LouisianaO.
1	74	9778	Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.	Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
0	75	9779	If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.	Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
0	76	9780	Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.	Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
1	77	9781	Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,	And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
0	78	9782	Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?	Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
0	79	9783	I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.	If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
0	80	9784	Mary wore three links of chain.	Every link was Jesus's name.
0	81	9785	Keepa your hand on that plow, hold on!	Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
0	82	9786	Keepa your hand on that plow, hold on!	Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,

0	89	9793	I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.	Baby, let me follow you down,
0	90	9794	Baby, let me follow you down,	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	91	9795	If you just let me follow you down.	Can I come home with you?

0	95	9799	If you just let me follow you down.	Yes, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	96	9800	There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun	And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl  and me  oh, God!  I'm a one.
0	97	9801	My mother was a tailor  she sewed these new blue jeans.	My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
0	98	9802	Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk	And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
0	99	9803	He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around	And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
0	100	9804	Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,	But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
0	101	9805	Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.	I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
0	102	9806	I'm going back to New Orleans  my race is almost run.	I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
0	103	9807	There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun	And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl  and me  oh, God!  I'm a one.
0	104	9808	I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,	Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
0	105	9809	Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,	Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
0	106	9810	I've got the freight train blues!	Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
0	107	9811	And when the whistle blows, I got to go  baby, don't you know?	It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
0	108	9812	Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,	She was the only daughter of the engineer.
0	109	9813	My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,	It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
0	110	9814	I got the freight train blues!	Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
0	111	9815	And when the whistle blows, I got to go  oh, mama, don't you know?	Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
0	112	9816	Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again	Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
0	113	9817	Every place I wanna go	I never can go because, you know,
0	114	9818	I got the freight train blues!	Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
0	115	9819	I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,	Walking a road other men have gone down.
0	116	9820	I'm seeing your world of people and things,	Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
0	117	9821	Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song	'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
0	118	9822	Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.	It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
0	119	9823	Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know	All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
0	120	9824	I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough	'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
0	121	9825	Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,	And to all the good people that traveled with you.
0	122	9826	Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men	That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
0	123	9827	I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.	Somewhere down the road some day,
0	124	9828	The very last thing that I'd want to do	Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
1	125	9829	Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,	Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
0	126	9830	There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:	You can see that my grave is kept clean.
1	127	9831	And there's two white horses following me,	And there's two white horses following me,
0	128	9832	I got two white horses following me,	Waiting on my burying ground.
1	129	9833	Did you ever hear that coffin sound?	Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
0	130	9834	Did you ever hear that coffin sound?	Means another poor boy is underground.
1	131	9835	Did you ever hear them church bells toll?	Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
0	132	9836	Did you ever hear them church bells toll?	Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
1	133	9837	Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,	And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
0	134	9838	Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.	Now I believe what the Bible told.
1	135	9839	There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,	And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
0	136	9840	There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:	See that my grave is kept clean.
0	137	9841	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
0	138	9842	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
0	139	9843	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
1	140	9844	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	141	9845	Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
0	142	9846	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
0	143	9847	Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
1	144	9848	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	145	9849	Yes, and how many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
0	146	9850	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
0	147	9851	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
1	148	9852	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	149	9853	If you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	150	9854	Remember me to the one who lives there	For she once was a true love of mine.
0	151	9855	If you go when the snowflakes storm,	When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
0	152	9856	Please see she has a coat so warm,	To keep her from the howling winds.
0	153	9857	Please see if her hair hangs long,	If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
0	154	9858	Please see for me if her hair's hanging long	For that's the way I remember her best.
0	155	9859	I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.	Many times I've often prayed
1	156	9860	In the darkness of my night,	In the brightness of my day.
0	157	9861	So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	158	9862	Remember me to the one who lives there	For she once was a true love of mine.
0	159	9863	Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,	You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
0	160	9864	You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,	I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
0	161	9865	You that never done nothing but build to destroy,	You play with my world like it's your little toy,
0	162	9866	You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes	And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
0	163	9867	Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,	A world war can be won you want me to believe,
0	164	9868	But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain	Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
0	165	9869	You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,	Then you set back and watch when the deathcount gets higher
0	166	9870	And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood	Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
0	167	9871	You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,	Fear to bring children into the world.
0	168	9872	For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,	You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
0	169	9873	How much do I know, to talk out of turn?	You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
0	170	9874	But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:	That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
0	171	9875	Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?	Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
0	172	9876	I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,	All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
0	173	9877	And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,	I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
0	174	9878	And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed	And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
0	175	9879	Well, I'm walking down the highway	With my suitcase in my hand.
0	176	9880	Yes, I'm walking down the highway	With my suitcase in my hand.
0	177	9881	Lord, I really miss my baby!	She's in some foreign land.
0	178	9882	Well, your streets are getting empty,	Lord, your highway's getting filled.
1	179	9883	And your streets are getting empty,	And your highway's getting filled.
0	180	9884	Well, the way I love that woman,	I swear it's bound to get me killed.
0	181	9885	Well, I been gambling so long,	Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
0	182	9886	Yes, I been gambling so long,	Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
0	183	9887	Right now I'm having trouble.	Please don't take away my highway shoes.
1	184	9888	Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,	Or I'm bound to die trying.
0	185	9889	Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,	Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
0	186	9890	Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean	And we'll leave this old highway behind.
0	187	9891	Well, the ocean took my baby,	My baby stole my heart from me.
0	188	9892	Yes, the ocean took my baby,	My baby took my heart from me.
0	189	9893	She packed it all up in a suitcase.	Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
0	190	9894	So, I'm walking down your highway	Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
0	191	9895	Yes, I'm walking down your highway	Just as far as my eyes can see,
0	192	9896	From the Golden Gate Bridge	All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
0	193	9897	Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley  that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, thisthis is a songthis wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.	Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
0	194	9898	Fixing everybody's troubles  everybody's 'cept mine.	Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
0	195	9899	Oh, you five and tencent women with nothing in your heads,	I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
0	196	9900	Go away from my door and my window too, right now.	Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
0	197	9901	I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.	I can walk anytime around the block.
0	198	9902	Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,	With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
0	199	9903	Watch out so you don't step on me!	Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
0	200	9904	Pull out your sixshooter and rob every bank you can see.	Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
1	201	9905	Oh, where have you been, my blueeyed son?	And where have you been, my darling young one?
0	202	9906	I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,	I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
0	203	9907	I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,	I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
0	204	9908	I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	205	9909	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	Oh, what did you see, my blueeyed son?
0	206	9910	And what did you see, my darling young one?	I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
0	207	9911	I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,	I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
0	208	9912	I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,	I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
0	209	9913	I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,	I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
0	210	9914	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
1	211	9915	What did you hear, my blueeyed son?	And what did you hear, my darling young one?
0	212	9916	I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,	I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
0	213	9917	I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,	I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
0	214	9918	I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,	I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
0	215	9919	I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	216	9920	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	Oh, what did you meet, my blueeyed son?
0	217	9921	And who did you meet, my darling young one?	I met a young child beside a dead pony,
0	218	9922	I met a white man who walked a black dog,	I met a young woman whose body was burning,
0	219	9923	I met a young girl  she gave me a rainbow,	I met one man who was wounded in love,
0	220	9924	I met another man who was wounded in hatred,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	221	9925	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	And what'll you do now, my blueeyed son?
0	222	9926	And what'll you do now, my darling young one?	I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
0	223	9927	I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,	Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
0	224	9928	Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,	Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
0	225	9929	And the executioner's face is always wellhidden,	Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
0	226	9930	Where black is the color, where none is the number,	And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
0	227	9931	And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,	And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
0	228	9932	But I'll know my song well before I start singing,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
0	229	9933	Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	If'n you don't know by now.
0	230	9934	And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 	It'll never do, somehow.
0	231	9935	When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,	Look out your window and I'll be gone.
0	232	9936	You're the reason I'm traveling on,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	233	9937	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,	The light I never knowed.
0	234	9938	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe 	I'm on the dark side of the road.
0	235	9939	But I wish there was something you would do or say	To try and make me change my mind and stay.
0	236	9940	But we never did too much talking, anyway.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	237	9941	So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,	Like you never done before.
0	238	9942	And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal 	I can't hear you anymore.
0	239	9943	I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.	I once loved a woman  a child, I am told.
0	240	9944	I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	241	9945	So long, honey babe.	Where I'm bound I can't tell.
0	242	9946	Goodbye's too good a word, babe,	"So I'll just say ""Fare thee well""."
0	243	9947	I ain't saying you treated me unkind.	You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
0	244	9948	You just kinda wasted my precious time,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	245	9949	While riding on a train going west,	I fell asleep for to take my rest.
0	246	9950	I dreamed a dream that made me sad,	Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
0	247	9951	With halfdamp eyes I stared to the room	Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
0	248	9952	Where we together weathered many a storm,	Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
0	249	9953	By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,	Our words was told, our songs was sung,
0	250	9954	Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,	Joking and talking about the world outside.
0	251	9955	With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,	We never much thought we could get very old,
0	252	9956	We thought we could sit forever in fun.	Our chances really was a million to one.
0	253	9957	As easy it was to tell black from white,	It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
0	254	9958	And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit	That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
0	255	9959	How many a year has passed and gone,	Many a gamble has been lost and won,
0	256	9960	And many a road taken by many a first friend 	And each one I've never seen again.
0	257	9961	I wishI wishI wish in vain	That we could sit simply in that room again.
0	258	9962	Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,	I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
0	259	9963	Oxford Town, Oxford Town,	Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
0	260	9964	Sun don't shine above the ground.	Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
0	261	9965	He went down to Oxford Town.	Guns and clubs followed him down
0	262	9966	All because his face was brown.	Better get away from Oxford Town.
0	263	9967	Oxford Town around the bend,	Come to the door, he couldn't get in
0	264	9968	All because of the color of his skin.	What do you think about that, my friend?
0	265	9969	Me and my gal, my gal's son,	We got met with a tear gas bomb.
1	266	9970	I don't even know why we come.	Going back where we come from.
0	267	9971	Oxford Town in the afternoon,	Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
0	268	9972	Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.	Somebody better investigate soon.
0	269	9973	Corrina, Corrina,	Gal, where you been so long?
0	270	9974	Corrina, Corrina,	Gal, where you been so long?
0	271	9975	I been worrying about you, baby.	Baby, please come home.
1	272	9976	I got a bird that whistles,	I got a bird that sings.
1	273	9977	I got a bird that whistles,	I got a bird that sings.
1	274	9978	But I ain't got Corrina.	Life don't mean a thing.
1	275	9979	Corrina, Corrina,	Gal, you're on my mind.
1	276	9980	Corrina, Corrina,	Gal, you're on my mind.
0	277	9981	I was sitting down thinking of you.	I just can't keep from crying.
0	278	9982	One time ago a crazy dream came to me,	I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
0	279	9983	Went to the doctor the very next day	To see what kinda words he could say.
0	280	9984	Said it was a bad dream.	"""I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."""
0	281	9985	"I said, ""Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"""	"He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"""
0	282	9986	"He grabbed my arm, I said ""Ouch!"""	As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
0	283	9987	"He said, ""Tell me about it."""	"""Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,"
0	284	9988	It was all over by a quarter past.	I was down in the sewer with some little lover
0	285	9989	When I peeked out from a manhole cover,	Wondering who turned the lights on us.
0	286	9990	"""Well, I got up and I walked around,"	Up and down the lonesome town.
0	287	9991	I stood wondering which way to go.	I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
0	288	9992	It was a normal day.	"""Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell"
0	289	9993	And I leaned my head and I give a yell:	'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
0	290	9994	Shotgun fired and away I ran.	I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
0	291	9995	"""Down the corner by the hot dog stand,"	I seen a man.
0	292	9996	I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'	He screamed a bit and away he flew.
0	293	9997	Thought I was a communist.	"""Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,"
0	294	9998	I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'	Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
0	295	9999	She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?	You seen what happened last time they started.'
0	296	10000	"""Well, I seen your Cadillac window uptown."	There was nobody around.
0	297	10001	I got into the driver's seat	And I drove down Fortysecond Street,
0	298	10002	In my Cadillac.	Good car to drive, after a war.
0	299	10003	"""Well, I remember seeing some ad"	So I turned on my Conelrad.
0	300	10004	But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill	So the radio didn't work so well.
0	301	10005	Turned on my record player.	It was RockADay Johnny singing,
0	302	10006	'Tell your ma, tell your pa,	Our loves are gonna grow, oohwah, oohwah.'
0	303	10007	"""I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,"	I needed somebody to talk to.
0	304	10008	So, I called up the operator of time	Just to hear a voice of some kind.
0	305	10009	'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'	"She said that for over an hour and I hung up."""
0	306	10010	Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,	"Saying, ""Hey, I've been having the same old dreams."
0	307	10011	But mine was a little different, you see.	I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
0	308	10012	"I didn't see you around."""	Well, now, time passed and now it seems
1	309	10013	Everybody's having them dreams.	Everybody sees hisself
0	310	10014	Walking around with no one else.	"""Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."""
0	311	10015	I think Abraham Lincoln said that.	"""I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."""
1	312	10016	Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.	Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
0	313	10017	Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.	I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
0	314	10018	Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.	Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
0	315	10019	Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.	Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
0	316	10020	I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.	Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
1	317	10021	Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.	Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
0	318	10022	Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man	Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
0	319	10023	Well, I took me a woman late last night.	I was threefourths drunk, she looked alright 
0	320	10024	Till she started peeling off her onion gook.	"She took off her wig, said, ""How do I look?"""
0	321	10025	I's highflying, barenaked, out the window!	Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
0	322	10026	Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.	Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
0	323	10027	'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.	She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
0	324	10028	I's out there painting on the old woodshed	When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
0	325	10029	I went down to scrub and rub,	But I had to sit in back of the tub.
0	326	10030	Cost a quarter, halfprice.	Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
0	327	10031	It's President Kennedy calling me up.	"He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"""
0	328	10032	"I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,"	Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
0	329	10033	"Country'll grow."""	Well, I got a woman five feet short,
0	330	10034	She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.	She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
0	331	10035	Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.	She's a maneater, meatgrinder, bad loser.
0	332	10036	Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:	I got a woman who works herself blind.
0	333	10037	Works up to her britches, up to her neck,	Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
0	334	10038	She's a humdinger, folksinger.	Late one day in the middle of the week,
0	335	10039	My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.	I chased me a woman up the hill
0	336	10040	Right in the middle of an airraid drill.	I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
0	337	10041	Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,	He's running for office on the ballot note.
0	338	10042	He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,	Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
0	339	10043	He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.	Oh, set me down on a television floor,
0	340	10044	I'll flip the channel to number four.	Out of the shower comes a football man
0	341	10045	With a bottle of oil in his hand,	Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
0	342	10046	Well, the funniest woman I ever seen	Was the greatgranddaughter of Mr. Clean.
0	343	10047	She takes about fifteen baths a day,	Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
0	344	10048	She's insane!	Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time 
0	345	10049	Levels my head and eases my mind.	I just walk along and stroll and sing,
0	346	10050	I see better days and I do better things.	I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
0	347	10051	Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
0	348	10052	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
0	349	10053	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
0	350	10054	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
0	351	10055	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
0	352	10056	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, they are achanging.
0	353	10057	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
0	354	10058	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.	The battle outside raging
0	355	10059	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
0	356	10060	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
0	357	10061	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
0	358	10062	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand	For the times, they are achanging.
0	359	10063	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
0	360	10064	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
0	361	10065	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
1	362	10066	Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,	Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
0	363	10067	With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.	You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
0	364	10068	You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.	Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
1	365	10069	Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,	Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
0	366	10070	You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.	The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
0	367	10071	The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.	If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
1	368	10072	You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,	You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
0	369	10073	Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.	Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
0	370	10074	Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.	Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
1	371	10075	Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,	Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
0	372	10076	You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.	Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
0	373	10077	Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.	Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
1	374	10078	Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,	Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
0	375	10079	Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.	There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
0	376	10080	There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.	Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
1	377	10081	There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,	There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
0	378	10082	Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,	The country I come from is called the Midwest,
0	379	10083	I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide	And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
0	380	10084	Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:	The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
0	381	10085	The cavalries charged, the Indians died.	Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
0	382	10086	The SpanishAmerican War had its day	And the Civil War too was soon laid away
0	383	10087	And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize	With guns in their hands and God on their side.
0	384	10088	The First World War, boys, it came and it went.	The reason for fighting I never did get,
0	385	10089	But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride	For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
0	386	10090	The Second World War came to an end,	We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
0	387	10091	Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,	The Germans now too have God on their side.
0	388	10092	I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,	If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
0	389	10093	To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,	And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
0	390	10094	But now we got weapons of chemical dust,	If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
0	391	10095	One push of the button and a shot the world wide,	And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
0	392	10096	Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,	That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
0	393	10097	But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide	Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
0	394	10098	So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,	The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
0	395	10099	The words fill my head and fall to the floor,	That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
0	396	10100	Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,	As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
0	397	10101	And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.	Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	398	10102	From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade	And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
0	399	10103	And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign	And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	400	10104	It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good	When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
0	401	10105	You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,	We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	402	10106	Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale	Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
0	403	10107	But the cardboardfilled windows and old men on the benches	Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
0	404	10108	In the north end of town my own children're grown.	But I was raised on the other.
0	405	10109	In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick	And I was brought up by my brother.
0	406	10110	The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,	The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
0	407	10111	Till one day my brother failed to come home,	The same as my father before him.
0	408	10112	Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.	My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
0	409	10113	And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring	To marry John Thomas, a miner.
0	410	10114	Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,	With the lunch bucket filled every season.
0	411	10115	What with three babies born, the work was cut down	To a half a day's shift with no reason.
0	412	10116	Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut	And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
0	413	10117	Till a man come to speak and he said in one week	That number eleven was closing.
0	414	10118	They complained in the East  they are paying too high.	They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
0	415	10119	That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,	Where the miners work almost for nothing.
0	416	10120	So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted	And the room smelled heavy from drinking
0	417	10121	When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long	As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
0	418	10122	I lived by the window as he talked to himself 	This silence of tongues, it was building.
0	419	10123	Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare	And I's left alone with three children.
0	420	10124	The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.	The stores one by one, they're folding.
0	421	10125	My children will go as soon as they grow.	Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
0	422	10126	A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,	A finger fired the trigger to his name,
1	423	10127	A handle hid out in the dark,	A hand set the spark,
1	424	10128	Two eyes took the aim	Behind a man's brain.
0	425	10129	But he can't be blamed,	He's only a pawn in their game.
0	426	10130	A South politician preaches to the poor white man:	You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
0	427	10131	You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.	And the Negro's name
1	428	10132	Is used, it is plain,	For the politician's gain,
1	429	10133	As he rises to fame	And the poor white remains
1	430	10134	On the caboose of the train.	But it ain't him to blame,
0	431	10135	He's only a pawn in their game.	The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
0	432	10136	And the marshals and cops get the same.	But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
1	433	10137	He's taught in his school	From the start by the rule
1	434	10138	That the laws are with him,	To protect his white skin,
1	435	10139	To keep up his hate,	So he never thinks straight
0	436	10140	'Bout the shape that he's in.	But it ain't him to blame,
0	437	10141	He's only a pawn in their game.	From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
0	438	10142	And the hoofbeats pound in his brain.	And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
1	439	10143	Shoot in the back	With his fist in a clinch,
1	440	10144	To hang and to lynch,	To hide 'neath a hood,
1	441	10145	To kill with no pain.	Like a dog on a chain,
1	442	10146	He ain'ta got no name.	But it ain't him to blame,
0	443	10147	He's only a pawn in their game.	Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
0	444	10148	They lowered him down as a king,	But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
1	445	10149	That fired the gun,	He'll see by his grave
1	446	10150	On the stone that remains,	Carved next to his name,
0	447	10151	His epitaph plain:	"""Only a Pawn in Their Game."""
1	448	10152	"""Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,"	I'm sailing away in the morning.
0	449	10153	Is there something I can send you from across the sea,	"From the place that I'll be landing?"""
0	450	10154	"""No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,"	There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
0	451	10155	Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled	"From across that lonesome ocean."""
0	452	10156	"""Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,"	Made of silver or of golden,
1	453	10157	Either from the mountains of Madrid	"Or from the coast of Barcelona."""
0	454	10158	"""Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night"	And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
0	455	10159	I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss	"For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."""
0	456	10160	"""That I might be gone a long, old time"	And it's only that I'm asking,
0	457	10161	Is there something I can send you to remember me by	"To make your time more easypassing?"""
0	458	10162	"""Oh, how canhow can you ask me again?"	It only brings me sorrow.
0	459	10163	The same thing I would want today	"I would want again tomorrow."""
0	460	10164	Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,	It was from her ship sailing,
0	461	10165	"Saying, ""I don't know when I'll be coming back again,"	"It depends on how I'm feeling."""
0	462	10166	"""If you, my love, must think that way,"	I'm sure your mind is roaming,
0	463	10167	I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,	But with the country to where you're going.
0	464	10168	"""So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,"	Take heed of the stormy weather.
0	465	10169	And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:	"Spanish boots of Spanish leather."""
0	466	10170	Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop	And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
0	467	10171	Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	468	10172	And the sea will split and the ships will hit	And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
0	469	10173	And the tide will sound and the waves will pound	And the morning will be breaking.
0	470	10174	The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path	And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
0	471	10175	And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	472	10176	And the words that are used for to get the ship confused	Will not be understood as they're spoken
0	473	10177	For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night	And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
0	474	10178	A song will lift as the mainsail shifts	And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
0	475	10179	And the sun will respect every face on the deck,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	476	10180	And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold	For your weary toes to be touching
0	477	10181	And the ship's wise men will remind you once again	That the whole, wide world is watching.
0	478	10182	Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes	And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
0	479	10183	But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,	The hour when the ship comes in.
0	480	10184	"And they'll raise their hands, saying, ""We'll meet all your demands"","	"But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered!"""
0	481	10185	And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide	And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
0	482	10186	William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll	With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
0	483	10187	At a Baltimore hotel society gathering	And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
0	484	10188	As they rode him in custody down to the station	And booked William Zantzinger for firstdegree murder.
0	485	10189	But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
0	486	10190	William Zantzinger, who at twentyfour years	Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
0	487	10191	With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him	And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
0	488	10192	Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders	And swearwords and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
0	489	10193	And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.	But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
0	490	10194	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.	Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
0	491	10195	She was fiftyone years old and gave birth to ten children,	Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
0	492	10196	And never sat once at the head of the table	And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
0	493	10197	Who just cleaned up all the food from the table	And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
0	494	10198	Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane	That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
0	495	10199	Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,	And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
0	496	10200	And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
0	497	10201	In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel	To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
0	498	10202	And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded	And that even the nobles get properly handled
0	499	10203	Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em	And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
0	500	10204	Stared at the person who killed for no reason,	Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
0	501	10205	And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,	And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
0	502	10206	William Zantzinger with a sixmonth sentence.	Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
0	503	10207	Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,	Be it mine right or wrongfully,
0	504	10208	I let it slip gladly to my friends	To tie up the time most forcefully.
1	505	10209	But the bottles are done,	We've killed each one,
0	506	10210	And the table's full and overflowed,	And the corner sign
0	507	10211	Says it's closing time	So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
0	508	10212	Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,	I did not do it harmfully
0	509	10213	And every girl that ever I've hurt,	I did not do it knowingly.
0	510	10214	But, to remain as friends,	You need the time to make amends and stay behind
1	511	10215	And, since my feet are now fast	And point away from the past,
0	512	10216	I'll bid farewell and be down the line.	Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
0	513	10217	The cause was there before we came	And every cause that ever I fought,
0	514	10218	I fought it full without regret or shame.	But the dark does die
0	515	10219	As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes	Must meet the dawn
1	516	10220	And, if I see the day,	I'd only have to stay,
0	517	10221	So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.	Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
0	518	10222	I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,	But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
0	519	10223	It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.	But the time ain't tall,
0	520	10224	Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed	By no special friend
0	521	10225	And, though the line is cut,	It ain't quite the end.
0	522	10226	I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.	Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
0	523	10227	To disgrace, distract, and bother me,	And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
0	524	10228	And the dust of rumors covers me.	But, if the arrow is straight
0	525	10229	And the point is slick,	It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
1	526	10230	So I'll make my stand	And remain as I am
0	527	10231	I ain't looking to compete with you,	Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
1	528	10232	Simplify you, classify you,	Deny, defy, or crucify you.
0	529	10233	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
0	530	10234	No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,	Frighten you or uptighten you,
1	531	10235	Drag you down or drain you down,	Chain you down or bring you down.
0	532	10236	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	533	10237	I ain't looking to block you up,	Shock or knock or lock you up,
1	534	10238	Analyze you, categorize you,	Finalize you or advertise you.
0	535	10239	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
0	536	10240	I don't wanna straightface you,	Race or chase you, track or trace you,
1	537	10241	Or disgrace you or displace you,	Or define you or confine you.
0	538	10242	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	539	10243	I don't wanna meet your kin,	Make you spin or do you in,
1	540	10244	Or select you or dissect you,	Or inspect you or reject you.
0	541	10245	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	542	10246	I don't wanna fake you out,	Take or shake or forsake you out,
0	543	10247	I ain't looking for you to feel like me,	See like me or be like me.
0	544	10248	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	545	10249	I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,	I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
0	546	10250	Wishing my longlost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.	I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
0	547	10251	Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.	Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
1	548	10252	If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,	If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
0	549	10253	You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.	Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
0	550	10254	Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.	Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
1	551	10255	Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,	Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
0	552	10256	Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem	Cannot hold you to its heat.
0	553	10257	Your temperature is too hot for taming.	Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
0	554	10258	I am homeless, come and take me	To reach of your rattling drums.
0	555	10259	Let me know, babe, all about my fortune	Down along my restless palms.
0	556	10260	Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.	I have fallen far beneath
0	557	10261	Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,	And your flashing diamond teeth.
0	558	10262	The night is pitchblack, come and make my	Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
0	559	10263	Let me know, babe  I'm nearly drowning 	If it's you my lifelines trace.
0	560	10264	I been wondering all about me	Ever since I seen you there.
0	561	10265	On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.	I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
0	562	10266	You have slayed me, you have made me.	I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
0	563	10267	I got to know, babe: will you surround me	So I can know if I'm really real?
0	564	10268	Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,	We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
0	565	10269	As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,	Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
0	566	10270	Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,	Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
0	567	10271	And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
0	568	10272	Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched	With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
0	569	10273	As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,	Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
0	570	10274	Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,	Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
0	571	10275	Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
0	572	10276	Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,	The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
0	573	10277	That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,	Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
0	574	10278	Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,	Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
0	575	10279	And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
0	576	10280	In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales	For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
0	577	10281	Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,	All down in takenforgranted situations,
0	578	10282	Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,	For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute,
0	579	10283	For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
0	580	10284	Even though a cloud's white curtain in a faroff corner flared	And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
0	581	10285	Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones	Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
0	582	10286	Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,	For the lonesomehearted lovers with too personal a tale,
0	583	10287	And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
0	584	10288	Starryeyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,	Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
0	585	10289	As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,	Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
0	586	10290	Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,	For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strungout ones and worse,
0	587	10291	And for every hungup person in the whole wide universe,	And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
1	588	10292	I'm just average, common too.	I'm just like him, the same as you.
0	589	10293	I'm everybody's brother and son.	I ain't different than anyone!
1	590	10294	Ain't no use to talk to me.	It's just the same as talking to you.
0	591	10295	I was shadowboxing early in the day.	I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
0	592	10296	"I said, ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come."	26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
0	593	10297	5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.	99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
0	594	10298	"14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"""	Well, I don't know, but I've been told
0	595	10299	The streets of heaven are lined with gold.	I ask you how things could get much worse 
0	596	10300	If the Russians happen to get up there first.	Wowee! Pretty scary!
1	597	10301	Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.	I want everybody to be free.
0	598	10302	But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater	Move in next door, marry my daughter,
0	599	10303	You must think I'm crazy!	I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
0	600	10304	Well, I set my monkey on the log	And ordered him to do the Dog.
0	601	10305	He wagged his tail and shook his head	And he went and did the Cat instead.
0	602	10306	He's a weird monkey, very funky.	I sat with my highheeled sneakers on,
0	603	10307	Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.	I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
0	604	10308	And my wighat was falling in my face,	But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
0	605	10309	I got a woman, she's so mean,	She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
0	606	10310	Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,	Puts bubblegum in my food.
0	607	10311	"She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey""."	Now, I got a friend who spends his life
0	608	10312	Stabbing my picture with a bowieknife,	Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
0	609	10313	When my name comes up he pretends to barf.	I've got a million friends!
0	610	10314	Now, they asked me to read a poem	At the sorority sisters' home.
0	611	10315	I got knocked down and my head was swimming 	I wound up with the Dean of Women!
1	612	10316	Yippee!	I'm a poet, I know it.
0	613	10317	Hope I don't blow it.	I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
0	614	10318	So I look like a walking mountain range	And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
0	615	10319	Out to the country club and the golf course.	Carry the New York Times,
0	616	10320	Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.	Now, you're probably wondering by now
0	617	10321	Just what this song is all about.	What's probably got you baffled more
0	618	10322	Is what this thing here is for.	It's nothing  it's something I learned over in England.
0	619	10323	Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.	The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
0	620	10324	For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes	And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
0	621	10325	Your cracked countrylips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.	Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
0	622	10326	But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.	It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
0	623	10327	I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.	I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
0	624	10328	You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.	Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
0	625	10329	I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.	If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
0	626	10330	From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,	That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
0	627	10331	I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring	For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
0	628	10332	Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.	And someday maybe  who knows, baby?  I'll come and be crying to you.
0	629	10333	I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.	I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
0	630	10334	"I said, ""Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"""	I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
0	631	10335	When out comes a farmer  he musta thought that I was nuts.	He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
0	632	10336	I fell down to my bended knees,	"Saying, ""I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"""
0	633	10337	He cocked his rifle and began to shout,	"""Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"""
0	634	10338	"I said, ""No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true."	"I'm a cleancut kid and I been to college, too."""
0	635	10339	Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.	She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
0	636	10340	I immediately tried to cool it with her dad	And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
0	637	10341	"He said, ""What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"""	"I said, ""I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."""
0	638	10342	Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.	"He said, ""I guess you're tired."" He said it kinda sly."
0	639	10343	"I said, ""Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."""	"He said, ""I got a bed for you underneath the stove."
0	640	10344	Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:	"That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."""
0	641	10345	I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.	There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
0	642	10346	"She said, ""Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."""	"I said, ""Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"""
0	643	10347	I knew I had to split, but I did not know how	"When she said, ""Would you like to take that shower now?"""
0	644	10348	Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out	'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
0	645	10349	I had to say something to strike him very weird	"So I yelled, ""I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"""
0	646	10350	Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way	"As he came charging down the stairs, saying, ""What's that I heard you say?"""
0	647	10351	"I said, ""I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."""	And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
0	648	10352	Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.	As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
0	649	10353	Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,	"""You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"""
0	650	10354	Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.	I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
0	651	10355	And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour	And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
0	652	10356	"Rita said ""Come back!"" and he started to load."	The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
0	653	10357	Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell	Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
0	654	10358	He still waits for me, constant on the sly.	He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
0	655	10359	Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.	Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
0	656	10360	Crimson flames tied through my ears,	Rolling, highandmighty traps
0	657	10361	Pounced with fire on flaming roads,	Using ideas as my maps.
0	658	10362	"""We'll meet on edges soon,"" said I,"	Proud 'neath heated brow.
0	659	10363	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	660	10364	Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth.	"""Rip down all hate!"" I screamed."
0	661	10365	Lies that life is blackandwhite	Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
0	662	10366	Romantic facts of musketeers	Foundationed deep somehow.
0	663	10367	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	664	10368	Girls' faces formed the forward path	From phony jealousy
1	665	10369	To memorizing politics	Of ancient history,
0	666	10370	Flung down by corpse evangelists,	Unthought of, though, somehow.
0	667	10371	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	668	10372	A selfordained professor's tongue,	Too serious to fool,
0	669	10373	Spouted out that liberty	Is just equality in school.
0	670	10374	"""Equality"". I spoke the word"	As if a wedding vow.
0	671	10375	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	672	10376	In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand	At the mongrel dogs who teach,
0	673	10377	Fearing not I'd become my enemy	In the instant that I preach,
0	674	10378	My existence led by confusion boats,	Mutiny from stern to bow.
0	675	10379	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	676	10380	Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,	Too noble to neglect,
0	677	10381	Deceived me into thinking	I had something to protect.
0	678	10382	Good and bad, I define these terms	Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
0	679	10383	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
1	680	10384	I can't understand,	She let go of my hand
0	681	10385	And left me here facing the wall.	I'd sure like to know
0	682	10386	Why she did go,	But I can't get close to her at all.
0	683	10387	Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,	She said she would never forget,
1	684	10388	But now morning is clear,	It's like I ain't here,
1	685	10389	She acts like we never met.	It's all new to me
0	686	10390	Like some mystery,	It could even be like a myth,
1	687	10391	But it's hard to think on	That she's the same one
0	688	10392	That last night I was with.	From darkness dreams are deserted 
1	689	10393	Am I still dreaming yet?	I wish she'd unlock
0	690	10394	Her voice once and talk	'Steada acting like we never met.
1	691	10395	If she ain't feeling well,	Then why don't she tell
0	692	10396	'Steada turning her back to my face?	Without any doubt
0	693	10397	She seems too far out	For me to return to or chase.
0	694	10398	And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,	Her mouth was watery and wet,
1	695	10399	But now something has changed	For she ain't the same,
0	696	10400	She just acts like we never have met.	If I didn't have to guess,
0	697	10401	I'd gladly confess	To anything I mighta tried.
0	698	10402	If I was with her too long	Or have done something wrong,
0	699	10403	I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.	Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
0	700	10404	I remember her whispering yet.	But evidently she don't,
0	701	10405	Evidently she won't.	She just acts like we never have met.
1	702	10406	I'm leaving today,	I'll be on my way,
0	703	10407	Of this I can't say very much,	But, if you want me to,
0	704	10408	I can be just like you	And pretend that we never have touched,
1	705	10409	And, if anybody asks me,	"""Is it easy to forget?"""
1	706	10410	"I'll say, ""It's easily done,"	You just pick anyone
0	707	10411	I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.	With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
0	708	10412	I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,	Gone as the season she's taken.
0	709	10413	In a young summer's youth, I stole her away	From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
0	710	10414	Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,	With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
0	711	10415	Of the two sisters, I loved the young.	With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
0	712	10416	The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone	By the jealousy of others around her.
0	713	10417	For her parasite sister I had no respect.	Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
0	714	10418	Countless visions of the other she'd reflect	As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
0	715	10419	Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.	The changes I was going through can't even be used
0	716	10420	For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose	The couldbe dream lover of my lifetime.
0	717	10421	With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip	A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
0	718	10422	Noticing not that I'd already slipped	To the sin of love's false security.
0	719	10423	From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,	Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
0	720	10424	"Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, ""Please,"	"What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"""
0	721	10425	And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,	The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
0	722	10426	At the peak of the night the king and the queen	Tumbled all down into pieces.
0	723	10427	The tragic figure. her sister did shout,	"""Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"""
0	724	10428	And I, in my armor, turning about	And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
0	725	10429	Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound,	Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
0	726	10430	And she in between, the victim of sound,	Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
0	727	10431	All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!	I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
0	728	10432	My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,	Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
0	729	10433	The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.	"The words to say ""I'm sorry"" I haven't found yet."
0	730	10434	I think of her often and hope whoever she's met	Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
0	731	10435	Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,	"""How goodhow good does it feel to be free?"""
0	732	10436	And I answer them most mysteriously,	"""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
0	733	10437	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
1	734	10438	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'm not the one you need.
0	735	10439	You say you're looking for someone	Who's never weak, but always strong,
0	736	10440	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
0	737	10441	Someone to open each and every door.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	738	10442	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	739	10443	Go lightly from the ledge, babe,	Go lightly on the ground.
0	740	10444	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I will only let you down.
0	741	10445	You say you're looking for someone	Who will promise never to part,
1	742	10446	Someone to close his eyes for you,	Someone to close his heart,
0	743	10447	Someone who will die for you and more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	744	10448	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	745	10449	Go melt back in the night,	Everything inside is made of stone.
0	746	10450	There's nothing in here moving	And, anyway, I'm not alone.
0	747	10451	You say you're looking for someone	Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
0	748	10452	To gather flowers constantly,	And to come each time you call,
0	749	10453	A lover for your life and nothing more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	750	10454	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	751	10455	Johnny's in the basement	Mixing up the medicine,
1	752	10456	I'm on the pavement	Thinking about the government,
0	753	10457	The man in the trenchcoat,	Badge out, laid off,
1	754	10458	Says he's got a bad cough,	Wants to get it paid off.
1	755	10459	Look out, kid,	It's something you did
1	756	10460	God knows when,	But you're doing it again,
0	757	10461	You better duck down the alleyway,	Looking for a new friend.
1	758	10462	The man in the coonskin cap	In the pigpen
0	759	10463	Wants eleven dollar bills,	You only got ten.
1	760	10464	Maggie comes fleetfoot,	Face full of black soot,
1	761	10465	Talking that the heat put	Plants in the bed, but
1	762	10466	The phone's tapped anyway,	Maggie says that many say
0	763	10467	They must bust in early May,	Orders from the D.A.
1	764	10468	Look out, kid,	Don't matter what you did,
1	765	10469	Don't walk on your tiptoes,	Don't try No Doz,
0	766	10470	Better stay away from those	That carry 'round a firehose,
1	767	10471	Keep a clean nose,	Watch the plainclothes,
0	768	10472	You don't need a weatherman	To know which way the wind blows.
1	769	10473	Ah, get sick, get well,	Hang around the inkwell,
1	770	10474	Ring bell, hard to tell	If anything is gonna sell,
1	771	10475	Try hard, get barred,	Get back, write Braille,
1	772	10476	Get jailed, jump bail,	Join the army if you fail.
1	773	10477	Look out, kid,	You're gonna get hit
1	774	10478	By losers, cheaters,	Sixtime users
0	775	10479	Hanging 'round the theaters,	Girl by the whirlpool's
1	776	10480	Looking for a new fool,	Don't follow leaders,
1	777	10481	Watch the parking meters.	Oh, get born, keep warm,
0	778	10482	Short pants, romance, learn to dance,	Get dressed, get blessed,
0	779	10483	Try to be a success,	Please her, please him, buy gifts,
0	780	10484	Don't steal, don't lift,	Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
1	781	10485	Look out, kid,	They keep it all hid,
1	782	10486	Better jump down a manhole,	Light yourself a candle,
1	783	10487	Don't wear sandals	And try to avoid the scandals.
1	784	10488	Don't wanna be a bum,	You better chew gum,
1	785	10489	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
0	786	10490	She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
0	787	10491	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,	But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
1	788	10492	She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,	She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
0	789	10493	She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.	She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
0	790	10494	She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,	She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
1	791	10495	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
1	792	10496	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	793	10497	Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.	I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
0	794	10498	It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	795	10499	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
0	796	10500	Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.	He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
0	797	10501	Then he fines you every time you slam the door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
1	798	10502	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
0	799	10503	Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,	His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
0	800	10504	The National Guard stands around his door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
1	801	10505	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
0	802	10506	Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,	Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
0	803	10507	She's 68, but she says she's 54.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
1	804	10508	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	805	10509	Well, I try my best to be just like I am,	But everybody wants you to be just like them.
0	806	10510	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave and I just get bored."	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	807	10511	My love, she speaks like silence,	Without ideals or violence.
0	808	10512	She doesn't have to say she's faithful.	Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
0	809	10513	People carry roses	And make promises by the hours.
0	810	10514	My love, she laughs like the flowers.	Valentines can't buy her.
0	811	10515	In the dimestores and busstations	People talk of situations,
0	812	10516	Read books, repeat quotations,	Draw conclusions on the wall.
1	813	10517	Some speak of the future.	My love, she speaks softly.
1	814	10518	She knows there's no success like failure	And that failure's no success at all.
1	815	10519	The cloakanddagger dangles.	Madams light the candles.
0	816	10520	In ceremonies of the horsemen	Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
0	817	10521	Statues made of matchsticks	Crumble into one another.
0	818	10522	My love winks, she does not bother.	She knows too much to argue or to judge.
1	819	10523	The bridge at midnight trembles.	The country doctor rambles.
0	820	10524	Bankers' nieces seek perfection,	Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
0	821	10525	The wind howls like a hammer	And the night blows rainy.
0	822	10526	My love, she's like some raven	At my window with a broken wing.
1	823	10527	Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?	Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
0	824	10528	'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.	Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no pictureframe.
0	825	10529	Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no pictureframe.	Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
1	826	10530	Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.	Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
0	827	10531	I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.	I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
0	828	10532	I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.	Don't ask me nothing about nothing  I just might tell you the truth.
1	829	10533	I got a woman in Jackson  oh, I ain't gonna say her name.	I got a woman in Jackson  I ain't gonna say her name.
0	830	10534	Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,	Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
0	831	10535	Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.	And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
0	832	10536	Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.	"I said, ""Who's in the fireplace?"" And you tell me Santa Claus."
0	833	10537	The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.	And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
0	834	10538	Well, I asked for something to eat  I'm hungry as a hog,	So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
0	835	10539	I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.	Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
0	836	10540	Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,	Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
0	837	10541	Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.	And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
0	838	10542	Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.	Then the mailman comes in  even he's gotta take a side.
0	839	10543	Even the butler, he's got something to prove.	And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
0	840	10544	I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land	Start over!
0	841	10545	I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.	I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
0	842	10546	"Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale."	Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
0	843	10547	"Haul on the bowline."" We sang that melody"	Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
0	844	10548	"""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land."	I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
0	845	10549	Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.	"He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."""
0	846	10550	Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/	He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
0	847	10551	Oh, me, I busted out  don't even ask me how.	I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
0	848	10552	Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,	"Where people carried signs around saying ""Ban the bums""."
0	849	10553	"I jumped right into line, saying, ""I hope that I'm not late,"""	When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
0	850	10554	I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.	I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
0	851	10555	The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powderblue cape.	"I ordered some Suzette. I said, ""Could you please make that crepe?"""
0	852	10556	Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.	Food was flying everywhere  I left without my hat.
0	853	10557	Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank	To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
0	854	10558	They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.	They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
0	855	10559	Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend	Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
0	856	10560	Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.	"I said, ""Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."""
0	857	10561	"The man says, ""Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"""	"I said, ""You know, they refused Jesus too."" He said, ""You're not Him!"
0	858	10562	"Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"""	I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
0	859	10563	I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,	"I went out the other door, this Englishman said ""Fab!"""
0	860	10564	As he saw me leap a hotdog stand and a chariot that stood	Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
0	861	10565	I ran right through the front door like a hobosailor does,	But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
0	862	10566	I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.	"He gave me his card, he said, ""Call me if they die."""
0	863	10567	I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street	When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
0	864	10568	A payphone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.	When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
0	865	10569	Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab	At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
0	866	10570	I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails	Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
0	867	10571	So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.	It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
0	868	10572	Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.	I was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past.
0	869	10573	They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.	They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
0	870	10574	I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.	They let me go right away  they were very paranoid.
0	871	10575	Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale	That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
0	872	10576	But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,	I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
0	873	10577	I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.	"He said his name was Columbus. I just said ""Good luck""."
0	874	10578	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	875	10579	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	876	10580	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
0	877	10581	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
0	878	10582	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
0	879	10583	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	880	10584	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	881	10585	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
0	882	10586	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
1	883	10587	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
0	884	10588	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
0	885	10589	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	886	10590	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	887	10591	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
0	888	10592	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
0	889	10593	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
0	890	10594	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
0	891	10595	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	892	10596	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	893	10597	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	894	10598	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
0	895	10599	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
0	896	10600	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
0	897	10601	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
0	898	10602	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
0	899	10603	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	900	10604	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	901	10605	Of war and peace the truth just twists.	Its curfewgull, it glides.
0	902	10606	Upon fourlegged forestclouds	The cowboy angel rides
0	903	10607	With his candle lit into the sun,	Though its glow is waxed in black 
0	904	10608	All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.	The lamppost stands with folded arms,
0	905	10609	Its iron claws attached	To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
0	906	10610	Though its shadow's metal badge	All and all can only fall
0	907	10611	With a crashing, but meaningless blow.	No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
0	908	10612	The savage soldier sticks his head in sand	And then complains
0	909	10613	Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf,	But still remains
0	910	10614	Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay	At ships with tattooed sails,
0	911	10615	Heading for the gates of Eden.	With a timerusted compass blade,
0	912	10616	Aladdin and his lamp	Sits with Utopian hermitmonks
0	913	10617	Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.	And, on their promises of paradise,
0	914	10618	You will not hear a laugh 	All except inside the gates of Eden.
0	915	10619	Relationships of ownership,	They whisper in the wings
0	916	10620	To those condemned to act accordingly	And wait for succeeding kings.
0	917	10621	And I try to harmonize with songs	The lonesome sparrow sings.
0	918	10622	There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.	The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
0	919	10623	Twowheeled, gypsy queen	And her silverstudded phantom cause
0	920	10624	The grayflannel dwarf to scream	As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
0	921	10625	Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.	And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
0	922	10626	The kingdoms of experience,	In the precious winds they rot
0	923	10627	While paupers change possessions,	Each one wishing for what the other has got.
0	924	10628	And the princess and the prince discuss	What's real and what is not.
0	925	10629	It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.	The foreign sun, it squints upon
0	926	10630	A bed that is never mine	As friends and other strangers
0	927	10631	From their fates try to resign,	Leaving men wholly, totally free
0	928	10632	To do anything they wish to do, but die.	And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
1	929	10633	At dawn my lover comes to me	And tells me of her dreams
0	930	10634	With no attempts to shovel the glimpse	Into the ditch of what each one means.
0	931	10635	At times I think there are no words	But these to tell what's true.
1	932	10636	Darkness at the break of noon	Shadows even the silver spoon,
0	933	10637	The handmade blade, the child's balloon,	Eclipses both the sun and moon.
0	934	10638	To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.	Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
0	935	10639	Suicide remarks are torn	From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
0	936	10640	Plays wasted words, proves to warn	That he not busy being born is busy dying.
0	937	10641	Temptation's page flies out the door,	You follow, find yourself at war,
0	938	10642	Watch waterfalls of pity roar,	You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
0	939	10643	You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.	So, don't fear if you hear
0	940	10644	A foreign sound to your ear.	It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
0	941	10645	As some warn victory, some downfall,	Private reasons, great or small,
0	942	10646	Can be seen in the eyes of those that call	To make all that should be killed to crawl
0	943	10647	"While others say, ""Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."""	Disillusioned words like bullets bark
0	944	10648	As human gods aim for their mark,	Make everything from toy guns that spark
0	945	10649	To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark.	It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
0	946	10650	While preachers preach of evil fates,	Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
0	947	10651	Can lead to hundreddollar plates,	Goodness hides behind its gates,
0	948	10652	But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.	And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
0	949	10653	It's only people's games that you got to dodge.	And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
0	950	10654	Advertising signs that con	You into thinking you're the one
1	951	10655	That can do what's never been done,	That can win what's never been won.
0	952	10656	Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.	You lose yourself, you reappear,
0	953	10657	You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,	Alone you stand with nobody near
0	954	10658	When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,	Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
0	955	10659	A question in your nerves is lit,	Yet you know there is no answer fit
0	956	10660	To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,	To keep it in your mind and not forget
0	957	10661	That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.	But, though the masters make the rules
0	958	10662	For the wise men and the fools,	I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
0	959	10663	For them that must obey authority	That they do not respect in any degree,
0	960	10664	Who despise their jobs, their destinies,	Speak jealously of them that are free,
0	961	10665	Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.	While some, on principles baptized
0	962	10666	To strict partyplatform ties,	Social clubs in drag disguise,
0	963	10667	Outsiders they can freely criticize,	"Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, ""God bless him."""
0	964	10668	While one who sings with his tongue on fire	Gargles in the ratrace choir,
0	965	10669	Bent out of shape from society's pliers,	Cares not to come up any higher,
0	966	10670	But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.	But, I mean no harm nor put fault
0	967	10671	On anyone that lives in a vault.	But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
0	968	10672	Oldlady judges watch people in pairs,	Limited in sex they dare
0	969	10673	To push fake morals, insult, and stare	While money doesn't talk, it swears,
0	970	10674	Obscenity  who really cares?  propaganda all is phony.	While them that defend what they cannot see
0	971	10675	With a killer's pride, security,	It blows their minds most bitterly,
0	972	10676	For them that think death's honesty	Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
0	973	10677	My eyes collide headon with stuffed	Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
0	974	10678	At pettiness, which plays so rough,	Walk upsidedown inside handcuffs,
0	975	10679	Kick my legs to crash it off,	"Say, ""OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"""
0	976	10680	And, if my thoughtdreams could be seen,	They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
0	977	10681	You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,	But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
0	978	10682	Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,	Crying like a fire in the sun.
0	979	10683	Look out, the saints are coming through	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	980	10684	The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,	Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
0	981	10685	The emptyhanded painter from your streets	Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
0	982	10686	The sky too is folding under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	983	10687	All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,	Your own emptyhanded army is all going home,
0	984	10688	Your lover, who just walked out your door,	Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
0	985	10689	The carpet too is moving under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	986	10690	Leave your steppingstones behind, there's something that calls for you,	Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
0	987	10691	The vagabond who's rapping at your door	Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
0	988	10692	Strike another match, go start anew,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	989	10693	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	990	10694	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."
0	991	10695	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out.
1	992	10696	Now you don't talk so loud.	Now you don't seem so proud
0	993	10697	About having to be scrounging your next meal.	How does it feel?
1	994	10698	How does it feel	To be without a home,
1	995	10699	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	996	10700	Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
0	997	10701	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
0	998	10702	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
0	999	10703	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
0	1000	10704	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
1	1001	10705	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	1002	10706	With no direction home,	A complete unknown,
0	1003	10707	Like a rolling stone?	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
0	1004	10708	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
0	1005	10709	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
0	1006	10710	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
0	1007	10711	He really wasn't where it's at	After he took from you everything he could steal?
1	1008	10712	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	1009	10713	To havebe on your own,	With no direction home,
1	1010	10714	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	1011	10715	Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
0	1012	10716	Exchanging all precious gifts,	But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
0	1013	10717	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
0	1014	10718	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
0	1015	10719	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	1016	10720	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	1017	10721	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	1018	10722	The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,	The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
0	1019	10723	The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,	But the town has no need to be nervous.
0	1020	10724	The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits	To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
0	1021	10725	A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits	At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
0	1022	10726	Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
0	1023	10727	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
0	1024	10728	"Screaming, she moans, ""I have just been made!"""	Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
0	1025	10729	"And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in."""	Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
0	1026	10730	He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,	"""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,"
0	1027	10731	"You will not die, it's not poison!"""	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
0	1028	10732	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
0	1029	10733	Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,	Looks up at his hero, the CommanderinChief,
0	1030	10734	"Saying, ""Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,"	"Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"""
0	1031	10735	The CommanderinChief answers him while chasing a fly,	"Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"""
0	1032	10736	And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky	"Saying, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"""
0	1033	10737	Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
0	1034	10738	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
0	1035	10739	Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,	Puts the piedpipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
0	1036	10740	Then sends 'em out to the jungle.	Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
0	1037	10741	With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps	With a fantastic collection of stamps
0	1038	10742	To win friends and influence his uncle.	Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
0	1039	10743	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,	I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
0	1040	10744	The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone	Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
0	1041	10745	At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,	But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
0	1042	10746	I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,	I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
0	1043	10747	Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.	He could die happily ever after.
0	1044	10748	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
0	1045	10749	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
0	1046	10750	Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole	And the National Bank at a profit sells roadmaps for the soul
0	1047	10751	To the old folks' home and the college.	I wish I could write you a melody so plain
0	1048	10752	That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,	That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
0	1049	10753	Of your useless and pointless knowledge.	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
0	1050	10754	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
0	1051	10755	Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby, can't buy a thrill.	Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
0	1052	10756	Well, if I die on top of the hill	And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
0	1053	10757	Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?	Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
0	1054	10758	Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?	But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
0	1055	10759	Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.	I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
0	1056	10760	Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.	Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
0	1057	10761	I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,	But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
0	1058	10762	She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.	Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
0	1059	10763	Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,	I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
0	1060	10764	Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.	Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
0	1061	10765	Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.	She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
0	1062	10766	She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.	Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
0	1063	10767	You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,	"You see somebody naked and you, you say, ""Who is that man?"""
0	1064	10768	You try so hard, but you don't understand	Just what you will say when you get home
0	1065	10769	Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You raise up your head and you ask, ""Is this where it is?"""
0	1066	10770	"And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his."""	"And you say, ""What's mine?"" And somebody else says, ""Where what is?"""
0	1067	10771	"And you say, ""Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"""	But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	1068	10772	You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,	Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
0	1069	10773	"And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?"""	"And you say ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone."
0	1070	10774	And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
0	1071	10775	To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.	But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
0	1072	10776	To all give a check to taxdeductible charity organizations.	Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
0	1073	10777	With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,	You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
0	1074	10778	You're very wellread, it's wellknown.	But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	1075	10779	Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,	He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
0	1076	10780	And without further notice he asks you how it feels	"And he says, ""Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."""
0	1077	10781	And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"Now, you see this oneeyed midget shouting the word ""now"""
0	1078	10782	"And you say, ""For what reason?"" And he says, ""How?"""	"And you say, ""What does this mean?"" And he screams back, ""You're a cow!"
0	1079	10783	"Give me some milk or else go home!"""	And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	1080	10784	Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,	You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
0	1081	10785	There oughtta be a law against you coming around,	You should be made to wear earphones
0	1082	10786	When your mother sends back all your invitations	And your father, to your sister he explains
0	1083	10787	That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
0	1084	10788	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?	Now, when all of the flowerladies want back what they have lent you
0	1085	10789	And the smell of their roses does not remain	And all of your children start to resent you,
1	1086	10790	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
0	1087	10791	Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned	Have died in battle or in vain
0	1088	10792	And you're sick of all this repetition,	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
0	1089	10793	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?	Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
0	1090	10794	At your feet to convince you of your pain,	Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
1	1091	10795	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
0	1092	10796	Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to	All lay down their bandanas and complain
0	1093	10797	And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,	Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
0	1094	10798	"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son."""	"Abe said, ""Man, you must be putting me on."""
0	1095	10799	"God said, ""No."" Abe said, ""What?"""	"God said, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but"
0	1096	10800	"The next time you see me coming you better run."""	"Well, Abe said, ""Where you want this killing done?"""
0	1097	10801	"God said, ""Oh, down Highway 61."""	Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
0	1098	10802	Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.	"He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?"""
0	1099	10803	"Howard said, ""There's only one place I know."""	"Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man! I got to run."""
0	1100	10804	Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun	"And said, ""That way down Highway 61."""
0	1101	10805	Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,	"""I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings"
0	1102	10806	And a thousand telephones that don't ring.	"Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"""
0	1103	10807	"And Louis the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son."""	"Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done."
0	1104	10808	"Just take everything down to Highway 61."""	Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
0	1105	10809	Told the first father that things weren't right.	"""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white."""
0	1106	10810	"He said, ""Come here and step into the light."""	"He says, ""Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."""
0	1107	10811	But the second mother was with the seventh son	And they were both out on Highway 61.
0	1108	10812	Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored	Trying to create a next world war.
0	1109	10813	He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.	"He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before,"
0	1110	10814	But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.	We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
0	1111	10815	When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Eastertime too	And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
0	1112	10816	Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,	They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
0	1113	10817	"Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her ""Thanks a lot"","	I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
0	1114	10818	I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot	And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
0	1115	10819	"Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the ""Goddess of Gloom"","	She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
0	1116	10820	And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon	As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
0	1117	10821	Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,	You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
0	1118	10822	If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came	Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
0	1119	10823	Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast	How they blackmailed the sergeantatarms into leaving his post
0	1120	10824	And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,	Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
0	1121	10825	I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,	Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
0	1122	10826	But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.	I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
0	1123	10827	They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,	The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
0	1124	10828	Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,	One hand is tied to the tightrope walker, the other is in his pants.
0	1125	10829	And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go	As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
0	1126	10830	"Cinderella, she seems so easy. ""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles"	And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davisstyle.
0	1127	10831	"And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, ""You belong to me, I believe."""	"And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."""
0	1128	10832	And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go	Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
0	1129	10833	Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,	The fortunetelling lady has even taken all her things inside.
0	1130	10834	All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,	Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
0	1131	10835	And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.	He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
0	1132	10836	Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,	On her twentysecond birthday she already is an old maid.
0	1133	10837	To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,	Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
0	1134	10838	And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,	She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
0	1135	10839	Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,	Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
0	1136	10840	Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,	Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
0	1137	10841	You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago	For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
0	1138	10842	Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,	But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
0	1139	10843	Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole	"And she also keeps the cards that read ""Have Mercy on His Soul""."
0	1140	10844	They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow	If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
0	1141	10845	Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,	The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
0	1142	10846	They're spoonfeeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,	Then they'll kill him with selfconfidence after poisoning him with words.
0	1143	10847	"And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get outta here if you don't know"	"Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"""
0	1144	10848	At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew	Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
0	1145	10849	Then they bring them to the factory where the heartattack machine	Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
0	1146	10850	Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go	Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
0	1147	10851	Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,	"Everybody's shouting, ""Which side are you on?"""
0	1148	10852	And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower	While Calypsosingers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
0	1149	10853	Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow	And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
0	1150	10854	Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the doorknob broke.	When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
0	1151	10855	All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,	I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
0	1152	10856	Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!	Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
0	1153	10857	Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,	They'll stone you just like they said they would,
1	1154	10858	They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,	Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
0	1155	10859	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1156	10860	Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,	They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
1	1157	10861	They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,	They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
0	1158	10862	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	1159	10863	They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,	They'll stone you when you are young and able,
0	1160	10864	They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,	"They'll stone you and then they'll say, ""Good luck."""
0	1161	10865	Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1162	10866	Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,	Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
1	1163	10867	They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,	They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
0	1164	10868	Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1165	10869	Alright!	Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
0	1166	10870	They'll stone you when you are walking home,	"They'll stone you and then say, ""You are brave,"""
0	1167	10871	They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.	But I would not feel so all alone,
0	1168	10872	Well, early in the morning till late at night	I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
0	1169	10873	I'm pledging my time to you,	Hoping you'll come through too.
0	1170	10874	Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.	He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
0	1171	10875	But I'm pledging my time to you,	Hoping you'll come through too.
0	1172	10876	Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.	And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
0	1173	10877	I'm pledging my time to you,	Hoping you'll come through too.
0	1174	10878	Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.	Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
0	1175	10879	I'm pledging my time to you,	Hoping you'll come through too.
0	1176	10880	Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.	Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
0	1177	10881	I'm pledging my time to you,	Hoping you'll come through too.
0	1178	10882	Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?	We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
0	1179	10883	And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.	Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
0	1180	10884	In this room the heatpipes just cough,	The country music station plays soft,
0	1181	10885	But there's nothingreally nothing to turn off,	Just Louise and her lover so entwined
0	1182	10886	And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.	In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the keychain
0	1183	10887	And the allnight girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,	We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
0	1184	10888	Louise, she's alright, she's just near.	She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
0	1185	10889	But she just makes it all too concise and too clear	That Johanna's not here.
0	1186	10890	The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face	Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
0	1187	10891	Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,	He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
0	1188	10892	And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.	He's sure got a lot of gall
0	1189	10893	To be so useless and all,	Muttering small talk at the wall
0	1190	10894	While I'm in the hall.	Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
0	1191	10895	And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.	Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
0	1192	10896	"Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while"","	But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
0	1193	10897	See the primitive wallflower freeze	When the jellyfaced women all sneeze.
0	1194	10898	"Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez,"	"I can't find my knees."""
0	1195	10899	Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,	But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
0	1196	10900	The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,	"Saying, ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."""
0	1197	10901	"But, like Louise always says, ""You can't look at much, can you, man?"" as she herself prepares for him."	And Madonna, she still has not showed,
0	1198	10902	We see this empty cage now corrode	Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
0	1199	10903	The fiddler, he now steps to the road,	"He writes ""Everything's been returned which was owed"""
0	1200	10904	On the back of the fish truck that loads	While my conscience explodes.
0	1201	10905	The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain	And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
0	1202	10906	I didn't mean to treat you so bad.	You shouldn't take it so personal.
0	1203	10907	I didn't mean to make you so sad.	You just happened to be there, that's all.
0	1204	10908	When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,	I thought that it was wellunderstood
0	1205	10909	That you'd be coming back in a little while.	I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
0	1206	10910	But sooner or later one of us must know	That you just did what you're supposed to do.
0	1207	10911	Sooner or later one of us must know	That I really did try to get close to you.
0	1208	10912	I couldn't see what you could show me.	Your scarf, it kept your mouth wellhid.
0	1209	10913	I couldn't see how you could know me,	But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
0	1210	10914	When you whispered in my ear	And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
1	1211	10915	I didn't realize just what I did hear,	I didn't realize how young you were.
0	1212	10916	But sooner or later one of us must know	That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
0	1213	10917	Sooner or later one of us must know	That I really did try to get close to you.
0	1214	10918	I couldn't see when it started snowing.	Your voice was all that I heard.
0	1215	10919	I couldn't see where we were going,	But you said you knew and I took your word.
0	1216	10920	And then you told me later as I apologized	That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
0	1217	10921	And I told you as you clawed out my eyes	That I never really meant to do you any harm.
0	1218	10922	But sooner or later one of us must know	That you just did what you're supposed to do.
0	1219	10923	Sooner or later one of us must know	That I really did try to get close to you.
0	1220	10924	The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organgrinder cries,	The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
0	1221	10925	The cracked bells and washedout horns blow into my face with scorn,	But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
1	1222	10926	I want you,	I want you,
1	1223	10927	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1224	10928	The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep	And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
0	1225	10929	And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup	And ask me to open up the gate for you.
1	1226	10930	I want you,	I want you,
1	1227	10931	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1228	10932	Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,	True love, they've been without it,
0	1229	10933	But all their daughters put me down	'Cause I don't think about it.
0	1230	10934	Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,	She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
0	1231	10935	She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,	She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
1	1232	10936	I want you,	I want you,
1	1233	10937	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1234	10938	Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.	No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
0	1235	10939	But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,	And because time was on his side and because I
1	1236	10940	Want you,	I want you,
1	1237	10941	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1238	10942	Oh, the ragman draws circles up and down the block.	I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
0	1239	10943	And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,	But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
0	1240	10944	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1241	10945	Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells	Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
0	1242	10946	And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,	But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
0	1243	10947	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1244	10948	Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.	She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
0	1245	10949	"And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met"	"And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."""
0	1246	10950	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1247	10951	Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,	But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
0	1248	10952	But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control	When Ihe built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
0	1249	10953	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1250	10954	Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,	Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
0	1251	10955	And me, I nearly got busted  and wouldn't it be my luck	To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
0	1252	10956	Oh, mama, is this really the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1253	10957	Now, the teenpreacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed	With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
0	1254	10958	"But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, ""Not even you can hide."	"You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."""
0	1255	10959	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1256	10960	"Now, the rainman gave me two cures, then he said, ""Jump right in."""	The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
0	1257	10961	And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind	And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
0	1258	10962	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1259	10963	When Ruthie says come see her in her honkytonk lagoon,	Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
0	1260	10964	"And I say, ""Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."""	"And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."""
0	1261	10965	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	1262	10966	Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.	They all fall there so perfectly  it all seems so welltimed.
0	1263	10967	And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price	You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
0	1264	10968	Oh, mama, is this really the end,	To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
1	1265	10969	Well, I see you got your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat,	Yes, I see you got your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1266	10970	Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,	Under your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1267	10971	Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?	Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
0	1268	10972	You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,	Your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1269	10973	Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.	We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
0	1270	10974	Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there	In your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1271	10975	"Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. ""It's bad for your health,"" he said."	Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
0	1272	10976	You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,	Your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1273	10977	Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.	Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
0	1274	10978	You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,	It's your brandnew leopardskin pillbox hat.
0	1275	10979	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.	Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
0	1276	10980	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
0	1277	10981	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	1278	10982	Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
0	1279	10983	Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.	She takes just like a woman  yes!
0	1280	10984	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	1281	10985	It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
0	1282	10986	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
0	1283	10987	And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
1	1284	10988	Ah, you fake just like a woman  yes, you do!	You make love just like a woman  yes, you do!
0	1285	10989	You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.	You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
1	1286	10990	I just can't do what I done before.	I just can't beg you anymore.
1	1287	10991	I'm gonna let you pass	And I'll go last.
0	1288	10992	Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	1289	10993	You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.	You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
0	1290	10994	Sometimes it gets so hard to care.	It can't be this way everywhere.
1	1291	10995	And I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last.
0	1292	10996	Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	1293	10997	Well, thethe judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.	But he's badly built and he walks on stilts  watch out he don't fall on you!
0	1294	10998	You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.	You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
0	1295	10999	You say my kisses are not like his,	But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
1	1296	11000	I'm just gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last.
0	1297	11001	Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	1298	11002	Standing on your window, honey  yes, I've been here before.	Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
0	1299	11003	How come you don't send me no regards?	You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
0	1300	11004	Kneeling 'neath your ceiling  yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.	I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
0	1301	11005	How come you send someone out to have me barred?	You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
0	1302	11006	Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.	But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
0	1303	11007	Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.	I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
0	1304	11008	Just what do you think you have to guard?	You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
0	1305	11009	Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.	He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
0	1306	11010	How come you get someone like him to be your guard?	You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
0	1307	11011	Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.	Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
0	1308	11012	I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet	With all these promises you left for me.
0	1309	11013	But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?	Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
0	1310	11014	Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.	Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
0	1311	11015	Youwhen you knew I had some other place to be.	Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
0	1312	11016	Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,	But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
0	1313	11017	Well, six white horses that you did promise	Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
0	1314	11018	But to live outside the law you must be honest.	I know you always say that you agree.
0	1315	11019	Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?	Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
0	1316	11020	But everybody else  even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.	Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
0	1317	11021	The Persian drunkard, he follows me.	Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
0	1318	11022	You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.	Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
0	1319	11023	Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed	That a man can't give his address out to bad company
0	1320	11024	And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad	In the ruins of your balcony,
0	1321	11025	"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"" I cried she was deaf"	"As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, ""What else you got left?"""
0	1322	11026	"It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, ""Don't forget,"	"Everybody must give something back for something they get."""
0	1323	11027	I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.	"And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, ""Don't get cute,"""
0	1324	11028	So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs	And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
0	1325	11029	She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.	And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
0	1326	11030	I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense	Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against 
0	1327	11031	Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.	"She said, ""No, dear."" I said, ""Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."""
0	1328	11032	She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,	And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
0	1329	11033	And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.	And youyou took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
0	1330	11034	Early in the morning, early in the morning	I'm calling you toI'm calling you to please come home.
0	1331	11035	Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.	Don't let me down, don't let me down.
0	1332	11036	I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.	You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
0	1333	11037	I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.	Yes, he is, nowyes, he is outside my yard.
0	1334	11038	Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.	Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
0	1335	11039	She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.	Well, I'd tell you what she wants if Ibut I just don't know how.
0	1336	11040	Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,	Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
0	1337	11041	Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.	Early in the morning, early in the morning
0	1338	11042	I'm calling you toI'm calling you to please come home.	Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
0	1339	11043	With your mercury mouth in the missionary times	And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
0	1340	11044	And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,	Oh, who do they think could bury you?
0	1341	11045	With your pockets well protected at last	And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
0	1342	11046	And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,	Who could they get to carry you,
0	1343	11047	Sadeyed lady of the lowlands,	Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes?
0	1344	11048	My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,	Should I put them by your gate
0	1345	11049	Or, sadeyed lady, should I wait?	With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
0	1346	11050	And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace	And your basementclothes and your hollow face,
0	1347	11051	Who among them could think he could outguess you?	With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
0	1348	11052	Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,	And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns,
0	1349	11053	Who among them would try to impress you,	Sadeyed lady of the lowlands,
0	1350	11054	Where the sadeyed prophets say that no man comes?	My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
0	1351	11055	Should I put them by your gate	Or, sadeyed lady, should I wait?
0	1352	11056	The kings of Tyrus with their convict list	Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
0	1353	11057	And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,	But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
0	1354	11058	With your childhood flames on your midnight rug	And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
0	1355	11059	And your cowboy mouth and your curfewplugs,	Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
0	1356	11060	Sadeyed lady of the lowlands,	Where the sadeyed prophets say that no man comes?
0	1357	11061	My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,	Should I leave them by your gate
0	1358	11062	Or, sadeyed lady, should I wait?	Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
0	1359	11063	To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.	But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
0	1360	11064	How could they ever mistake you?	They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
0	1361	11065	But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm	And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
0	1362	11066	How could they ever have persuaded you,	Sadeyed lady of the lowlands,
0	1363	11067	Where the sadeyed prophets say that no man's come?	My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
0	1364	11068	Should I leave them by your gate	Or, sadeyed lady, should I wait?
0	1365	11069	With your sheetmetal memory of Cannery Row	And your magazinehusband, who one day just had to go,
0	1366	11070	And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,	Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
0	1367	11071	Now you stand with your thief  you're on his parole.	With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
0	1368	11072	And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,	Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
0	1369	11073	Sadeyed lady of the lowlands,	Where the sadeyed prophets say that no man comes?
0	1370	11074	My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,	Should I leave them by your gate
0	1371	11075	Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,	They'll stone you just like they said they would,
1	1372	11076	They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,	Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
0	1373	11077	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1374	11078	Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,	They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
1	1375	11079	They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,	They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
0	1376	11080	But I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
1	1377	11081	They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,	They'll stone you when you are young and able,
0	1378	11082	They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,	"They'll stone you and then they'll say, ""Good luck."""
0	1379	11083	Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1380	11084	Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,	Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
1	1381	11085	They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,	They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
0	1382	11086	Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,	Everybody must get stoned.
0	1383	11087	Alright!	Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
0	1384	11088	They'll stone you when you are walking home,	"They'll stone you and then say, ""You are brave,"""
0	1385	11089	They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.	But I would not feel so all alone,
0	1386	11090	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
0	1387	11091	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
0	1388	11092	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
1	1389	11093	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	1390	11094	Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
0	1391	11095	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
0	1392	11096	Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
1	1393	11097	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	1394	11098	Yes, and how many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
0	1395	11099	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
0	1396	11100	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
1	1397	11101	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	1398	11102	Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
0	1399	11103	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
0	1400	11104	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
0	1401	11105	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
0	1402	11106	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
0	1403	11107	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, they are achanging.
0	1404	11108	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
0	1405	11109	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.	The battle outside raging
0	1406	11110	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
0	1407	11111	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
0	1408	11112	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
0	1409	11113	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand	For the times, they are achanging.
0	1410	11114	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
0	1411	11115	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
0	1412	11116	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
0	1413	11117	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
1	1414	11118	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'm not the one you need.
0	1415	11119	You say you're looking for someone	Who's never weak, but always strong,
0	1416	11120	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
0	1417	11121	Someone to open each and every door.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	1418	11122	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	1419	11123	Go lightly from the ledge, babe,	Go lightly on the ground.
0	1420	11124	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I will only let you down.
0	1421	11125	You say you're looking for someone	Who will promise never to part,
1	1422	11126	Someone to close his eyes for you,	Someone to close his heart,
0	1423	11127	Someone who will die for you and more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	1424	11128	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	1425	11129	Go melt back in the night,	Everything inside is made of stone.
0	1426	11130	There's nothing in here moving	And, anyway, I'm not alone.
0	1427	11131	You say you're looking for someone	Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
0	1428	11132	To gather flowers constantly,	And to come each time you call,
0	1429	11133	A lover for your life and nothing more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	1430	11134	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	1431	11135	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	1432	11136	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."
0	1433	11137	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out.
1	1434	11138	Now you don't talk so loud.	Now you don't seem so proud
0	1435	11139	About having to be scrounging your next meal.	How does it feel?
1	1436	11140	How does it feel	To be without a home,
1	1437	11141	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	1438	11142	Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
0	1439	11143	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
0	1440	11144	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
0	1441	11145	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
0	1442	11146	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
1	1443	11147	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	1444	11148	With no direction home,	A complete unknown,
0	1445	11149	Like a rolling stone?	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
0	1446	11150	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
0	1447	11151	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
0	1448	11152	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
0	1449	11153	He really wasn't where it's at	After he took from you everything he could steal?
1	1450	11154	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	1451	11155	To havebe on your own,	With no direction home,
1	1452	11156	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	1453	11157	Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
0	1454	11158	Exchanging all precious gifts,	But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
0	1455	11159	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
0	1456	11160	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
0	1457	11161	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	1458	11162	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	1459	11163	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	1460	11164	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	1461	11165	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	1462	11166	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
0	1463	11167	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
0	1464	11168	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
0	1465	11169	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	1466	11170	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	1467	11171	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
0	1468	11172	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
1	1469	11173	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
0	1470	11174	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
0	1471	11175	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	1472	11176	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	1473	11177	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
0	1474	11178	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
0	1475	11179	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
0	1476	11180	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
0	1477	11181	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	1478	11182	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	1479	11183	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	1480	11184	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
0	1481	11185	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
0	1482	11186	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
0	1483	11187	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
0	1484	11188	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
0	1485	11189	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	1486	11190	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
1	1487	11191	Johnny's in the basement	Mixing up the medicine,
1	1488	11192	I'm on the pavement	Thinking about the government,
0	1489	11193	The man in the trenchcoat,	Badge out, laid off,
1	1490	11194	Says he's got a bad cough,	Wants to get it paid off.
1	1491	11195	Look out, kid,	It's something you did
1	1492	11196	God knows when,	But you're doing it again,
0	1493	11197	You better duck down the alleyway,	Looking for a new friend.
1	1494	11198	The man in the coonskin cap	In the pigpen
0	1495	11199	Wants eleven dollar bills,	You only got ten.
1	1496	11200	Maggie comes fleetfoot,	Face full of black soot,
1	1497	11201	Talking that the heat put	Plants in the bed, but
1	1498	11202	The phone's tapped anyway,	Maggie says that many say
0	1499	11203	They must bust in early May,	Orders from the D.A.
1	1500	11204	Look out, kid,	Don't matter what you did,
1	1501	11205	Don't walk on your tiptoes,	Don't try No Doz,
0	1502	11206	Better stay away from those	That carry 'round a firehose,
1	1503	11207	Keep a clean nose,	Watch the plainclothes,
0	1504	11208	You don't need a weatherman	To know which way the wind blows.
1	1505	11209	Ah, get sick, get well,	Hang around the inkwell,
1	1506	11210	Ring bell, hard to tell	If anything is gonna sell,
1	1507	11211	Try hard, get barred,	Get back, write Braille,
1	1508	11212	Get jailed, jump bail,	Join the army if you fail.
1	1509	11213	Look out, kid,	You're gonna get hit
1	1510	11214	By losers, cheaters,	Sixtime users
0	1511	11215	Hanging 'round the theaters,	Girl by the whirlpool's
1	1512	11216	Looking for a new fool,	Don't follow leaders,
1	1513	11217	Watch the parking meters.	Oh, get born, keep warm,
0	1514	11218	Short pants, romance, learn to dance,	Get dressed, get blessed,
0	1515	11219	Try to be a success,	Please her, please him, buy gifts,
0	1516	11220	Don't steal, don't lift,	Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
1	1517	11221	Look out, kid,	They keep it all hid,
1	1518	11222	Better jump down a manhole,	Light yourself a candle,
1	1519	11223	Don't wear sandals	And try to avoid the scandals.
1	1520	11224	Don't wanna be a bum,	You better chew gum,
0	1521	11225	The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organgrinder cries,	The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
0	1522	11226	The cracked bells and washedout horns blow into my face with scorn,	But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
1	1523	11227	I want you,	I want you,
1	1524	11228	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1525	11229	The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep	And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
0	1526	11230	And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup	And ask me to open up the gate for you.
1	1527	11231	I want you,	I want you,
1	1528	11232	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1529	11233	Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,	True love, they've been without it,
0	1530	11234	But all their daughters put me down	'Cause I don't think about it.
0	1531	11235	Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,	She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
0	1532	11236	She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,	She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
1	1533	11237	I want you,	I want you,
1	1534	11238	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1535	11239	Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.	No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
0	1536	11240	But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,	And because time was on his side and because I
1	1537	11241	Want you,	I want you,
1	1538	11242	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	1539	11243	You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,	When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
0	1540	11244	You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,	You just want to be on the side that's winning.
0	1541	11245	You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.	If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
0	1542	11246	You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,	You had no faith to lose and you know it.
0	1543	11247	I know the reason that you talk behind my back,	I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
0	1544	11248	Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact	With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
0	1545	11249	You see me on the street, you always act surprised,	"You say, ""How are you?"", ""Good luck"", but you don't mean it"
0	1546	11250	When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed 	Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
0	1547	11251	No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,	If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
0	1548	11252	And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.	Don't you understand it's not my problem?
0	1549	11253	I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes	And just for that one moment I could be you.
0	1550	11254	Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,	You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
0	1551	11255	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.	Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
0	1552	11256	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
0	1553	11257	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	1554	11258	Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
0	1555	11259	Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.	She takes just like a woman  yes!
0	1556	11260	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	1557	11261	It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
0	1558	11262	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
0	1559	11263	And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
1	1560	11264	Ah, you fake just like a woman  yes, you do!	You make love just like a woman  yes, you do!
0	1561	11265	John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.	He traveled awith a gun in every hand.
0	1562	11266	All along this countryside he opened many a door,	But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
0	1563	11267	'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,	With his lady by his side he took a stand.
0	1564	11268	And soon the situation there was all but straightened out	For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
0	1565	11269	All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,	But no charge held against him could they prove.
0	1566	11270	And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.	He was never known to make a foolish move.
0	1567	11271	As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,	I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
0	1568	11272	I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.	I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
0	1569	11273	"""Depart from me this moment,"" I told her with my voice."	"Said she, ""But I don't wish to."" Said I, ""But you have no choice."""
0	1570	11274	"""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded from the corners of her mouth."	"""I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."""
0	1571	11275	Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,	Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
0	1572	11276	And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.	"""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me. ""I'm sorry for what she's done."""
0	1573	11277	I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,	Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
0	1574	11278	With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,	Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
0	1575	11279	"""Arise! Arise!"" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint."	"""Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!"
0	1576	11280	No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.	"But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."""
0	1577	11281	I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.	And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
0	1578	11282	Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.	I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
0	1579	11283	"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."
0	1580	11284	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
0	1581	11285	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
0	1582	11286	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."""
0	1583	11287	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
0	1584	11288	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
0	1585	11289	Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.	So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
0	1586	11290	And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,	"Saying, ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."""
0	1587	11291	Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,	But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
0	1588	11292	"""Could you please not stare at me like that?"" he said, ""It's just my foolish pride,"	"But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."""
0	1589	11293	"Well, Judas, he just winked and said, ""Alright, I'll leave you here."	"But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."""
0	1590	11294	"""I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."""	"Judas pointed down the road and said, ""Eternity."""
0	1591	11295	"""Eternity?"" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice."	"""That's right,"" said Judas, ""Eternity, though you might call it paradise."""
0	1592	11296	"""I don't call it anything,"" said Frankie Lee with a smile."	"""Alright,"" said Judas Priest, ""I'll see you after a while."""
0	1593	11297	Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean	When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
0	1594	11298	"Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?"	"Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."""
0	1595	11299	"""Oh, yes, he is my friend,"" said Frankie Lee in fright."	"""I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."""
0	1596	11300	"""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse."	"""Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."""
0	1597	11301	Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran	Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
0	1598	11302	"""What kind of house is this,"" he said, ""where I have come to roam?"""	"""It's not a house,"" says Judas Priest. ""It's not a house, it's a home."""
0	1599	11303	Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control	Over everything which he had made while the missionbells did toll.
0	1600	11304	He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun	With fourandtwenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
0	1601	11305	Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap	And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
0	1602	11306	For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst	Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
0	1603	11307	No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest 	Except of course the little neighborboy, who carried him to rest,
0	1604	11308	And he just walked along alone with his guilt so wellconcealed	"And muttered underneath his breath, ""Nothing is revealed."""
0	1605	11309	Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song	Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
0	1606	11310	So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load	And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
0	1607	11311	"""Oh, help me in my weakness,"" I heard the drifter say"	As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
0	1608	11312	"""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long."	"And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."""
0	1609	11313	Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.	"""You'd fail to understand,"" he said. ""Why must you even try?"""
0	1610	11314	Outside the crowd was stirring  you could hear it from the door;	Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
0	1611	11315	"""Oh, stop that cursed jury!"" cried the attendant and the nurse."	"""The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."""
0	1612	11316	Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape	And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
0	1613	11317	Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.	My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
0	1614	11318	When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give	And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
0	1615	11319	Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.	I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
0	1616	11320	All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.	And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
0	1617	11321	Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.	I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
0	1618	11322	Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.	And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
0	1619	11323	I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.	Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
0	1620	11324	I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.	And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
0	1621	11325	Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.	I had fourteenkarat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
0	1622	11326	But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,	Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
0	1623	11327	Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.	But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
0	1624	11328	Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,	And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
0	1625	11329	I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,	Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
0	1626	11330	That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,	Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
0	1627	11331	I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,	Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
0	1628	11332	Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,	Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
0	1629	11333	I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,	Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
0	1630	11334	Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.	I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
0	1631	11335	There was a wicked messenger  from Eli he did come,	With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
0	1632	11336	When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb	For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
0	1633	11337	He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.	Oftentimes he could be seen returning
0	1634	11338	Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:	"""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."""
0	1635	11339	Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part	And the people that confronted him were many.
0	1636	11340	And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:	"""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."""
1	1637	11341	Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.	Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
0	1638	11342	"I said, ""Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"""	Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
0	1639	11343	Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.	"She said, ""Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"""
1	1640	11344	Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.	Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
0	1641	11345	Close your eyes, close the door.	You don't have to worry any more.
0	1642	11346	I'll be your baby tonight.	Shut the light, shut the shade.
0	1643	11347	You don't have to be afraid.	I'll be your baby tonight.
0	1644	11348	Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  we're gonna forget it.	That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
0	1645	11349	Kick your shoes off, do not fear.	Bring that bottle over here.
0	1646	11350	If you're traveling to the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	1647	11351	Remember me to one who lives there	For she once was a true love of mine.
0	1648	11352	See for me that her hair's hanging down,	It curls and falls all down her breast.
0	1649	11353	See for me that her hair's hanging down.	That's the way I remember her best.
0	1650	11354	If you go when the snowflakes fall,	When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
0	1651	11355	Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,	To keep her from the howling winds.
0	1652	11356	If you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	1653	11357	Remember me to one who lives there	For she once was a true love of mine.
0	1654	11358	If you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	1655	11359	Remember me to one who lives there.	She once was a true love of mine,
1	1656	11360	A true love of mine,	True love of mine,
1	1657	11361	Is it rolling, Bob?	To be alone with you,
1	1658	11362	Just you and me.	Now, won't you tell me true,
0	1659	11363	Ain't that the way it oughtta be?	To hold each other tight
1	1660	11364	The whole night through.	Everything is always right
1	1661	11365	When I'm alone with you.	To be alone with you
1	1662	11366	At the close of the day,	With only you in view
0	1663	11367	While evening slips away.	It only goes to show
0	1664	11368	That, while life's pleasures be few,	The only one I know
0	1665	11369	Is when I'm alone with you.	They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
0	1666	11370	Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.	I wish tonight were here,
0	1667	11371	Bringing me all of your charms,	When only you are near
0	1668	11372	To hold me in your arms.	I'll always thank the Lord
0	1669	11373	When my working day's through.	I get my sweet reward,
0	1670	11374	I once held her in my arms.	She said she would always stay.
0	1671	11375	But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.	I threw it all away.
0	1672	11376	Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand	And rivers that ran through every day.
0	1673	11377	I musta been mad, I never knew what I had	Until I threw it all away.
0	1674	11378	Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.	Love and only love  it can't be denied.
0	1675	11379	No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.	Take a tip from one who's tried.
0	1676	11380	So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,	Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
0	1677	11381	For one thing for certain, you will surely be ahurting	If you throw it all away.
0	1678	11382	Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.	By golly, what more can I say?
0	1679	11383	Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.	Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
0	1680	11384	Man, that girl is out of sight.	Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
0	1681	11385	Well, you knoweven before I learned her name,	You know, I loved her just the same.
0	1682	11386	And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know	That she's my little lady and I love her so.
0	1683	11387	Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,	Turned my skies to blue from gray.
0	1684	11388	Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.	Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
0	1685	11389	By golly, what more can I say?	Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
1	1686	11390	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	1687	11391	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
0	1688	11392	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	1689	11393	Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but hishis hands are clean
0	1690	11394	And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	1691	11395	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it too.
0	1692	11396	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
0	1693	11397	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
1	1694	11398	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach for you in the night.
0	1695	11399	One more night the stars are in sight,	But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
0	1696	11400	Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,	But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
0	1697	11401	Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.	I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
0	1698	11402	I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky	For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
0	1699	11403	I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.	I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
0	1700	11404	One more night I will wait for the light	While the wind blows high above the tree.
0	1701	11405	Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,	But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
0	1702	11406	One more night the moon is shining bright	And the wind blows high above the tree.
0	1703	11407	Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,	But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
0	1704	11408	I have heard rumors all over town.	They say that you're planning to put me down.
0	1705	11409	All I'd like you to do	Is tell me that it isn't true.
0	1706	11410	They say that you've been seen with some other man,	That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
0	1707	11411	Darling, I'm acounting on you.	Tell me that it isn't true.
0	1708	11412	To know that some other man is holding you tight,	It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
0	1709	11413	All of these awful things that I have heard,	I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
0	1710	11414	So, darling, you better come through.	Tell me that it isn't true.
0	1711	11415	All of these awful things that I have heard,	I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
0	1712	11416	So, darling, I'm counting on you.	Tell me that it isn't true.
0	1713	11417	Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe 	Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
0	1714	11418	Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day 	Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
0	1715	11419	Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime  what do I care?	Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum  call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
0	1716	11420	Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose 	Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
0	1717	11421	I don't need much, that ain't no lie  ain't running any race!	Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
0	1718	11422	Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me 	Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
1	1719	11423	Throw my ticket out the window.	Throw my suitcase out there too.
0	1720	11424	Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
0	1721	11425	I should have left this town this morning,	But it was more than I could do.
0	1722	11426	Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long	For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
0	1723	11427	Is it really any wonder,	The love that a stranger might receive?
0	1724	11428	You cast your spell and I went under.	I find it so difficult to leave.
1	1725	11429	I can hear that whistle blowing.	I see that stationmaster too.
0	1726	11430	If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
1	1727	11431	Throw my ticket out the window.	Throw my suitcase out there too.
0	1728	11432	Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
0	1729	11433	All the tired horses in the sun,	How'm I supposed to get any riding done?

1	1750	11454	Alberta, let your hair hang low,	Alberta, let your hair hang low,
0	1751	11455	I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold	If you'll only let your hair hang low.
1	1752	11456	Alberta, what's on your mind?	Alberta, what's on your mind?
0	1753	11457	You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,	Alberta, what's on your mind?
1	1754	11458	Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,	Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,

0	1757	11461	I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold	If you'll only let your hair hang low.
0	1758	11462	I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.	You think you know the smile on her lips,
0	1759	11463	The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,	But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
0	1760	11464	You think you'll find a heaven of bliss	In each caress, in each tender kiss,
0	1761	11465	But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.	You stole her love from me one day,
0	1762	11466	You didn't care that it hurt me,	But you can never steal away
0	1763	11467	Memories of what used to be.	You think she's yours to have and to hold,
0	1764	11468	Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,	But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
0	1765	11469	I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,	They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
0	1766	11470	I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign	"And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore,"" in the days of '49 "
0	1767	11471	In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine	For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
0	1768	11472	My comrades, they all loved me well  a jolly, saucy crew,	A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
0	1769	11473	Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,	Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 
0	1770	11474	In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine	For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
0	1771	11475	There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight	And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
0	1772	11476	Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,	And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 
0	1773	11477	In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine	For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
0	1774	11478	There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,	Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
0	1775	11479	He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;	In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 
0	1776	11480	(Oh, my goodness!)	In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the daytimes I repine,
0	1777	11481	In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.	There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
0	1778	11482	He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,	One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
0	1779	11483	And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 	In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
0	1780	11484	For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.	Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
0	1781	11485	And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost	And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign 
0	1782	11486	"""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure""  in the days of '49 "	In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
1	1783	11487	For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,	In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
0	1784	11488	In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand	And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
0	1785	11489	I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,	In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
0	1786	11490	Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,	I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
0	1787	11491	The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast 	There she goes, my friend, she's arolling down at last.
0	1788	11492	Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,	She's away and westwardbound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
0	1789	11493	Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,	She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
0	1790	11494	This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me	'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
0	1791	11495	You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,	So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
0	1792	11496	Went out last night just to take a little round,	I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
0	1793	11497	I run right home and I went to bed	With a .44 smokeless under my head.
0	1794	11498	I began to think of what a deed I'd done,	I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
0	1795	11499	I made a good run, but I run too slow:	They overtook me down in Jericho.
0	1796	11500	Standing on a corner ajust ringing my bell,	Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
0	1797	11501	"He says, ""Young man, is your name Brown?"	"Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."""
0	1798	11502	"""Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,"	I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
0	1799	11503	First degree and second degree,	"If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"""
0	1800	11504	Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,	They put me on a train and they sent me back.
0	1801	11505	I had no one for to go my bail,	They crammed me back into the county jail 
0	1802	11506	Oh, yes, they did.	Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
0	1803	11507	The judge had the papers in his right hand 	Fortyone days, fortyone nights,
0	1804	11508	Fortyone years to wear the ball and the stripes 	Oh, no!
0	1805	11509	I went out last night to take a little round,	I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
0	1806	11510	I run right home and I went to bed,	A .44 smokeless under my head.
1	1807	11511	I bless the day I found you,	I want my arms around you,
0	1808	11512	So I beg you: let it be me.	Adon't take athis heaven from one,
0	1809	11513	If you must cling to someone,	Now and forever let it be me.
1	1810	11514	Each time we meet, love,	I find complete love;
1	1811	11515	Without your sweet love,	What would life be?
1	1812	11516	So, never leave me lonely,	Tell me that you love me only,
0	1813	11517	And asay you'll always let it be me.	So, never leave me lonely,
0	1814	11518	Tell me that you love me only,	And say you'll always let it be me.
0	1815	11519	I went out last night to take a little round,	I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
0	1816	11520	I run right home and I went to bed	With a .44 smokeless under my head.
0	1817	11521	I went out last night to take a little round,	I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
0	1818	11522	I run right home and I went to bed	With a .44 smokeless under my head.
0	1819	11523	I begun to think what a deed I'd done,	I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
0	1820	11524	I made a good run, but I run too slow:	They overtook me down in Jericho.
0	1821	11525	Standing on a corner aringing my bell,	Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
0	1822	11526	"He says, ""Young man, is your name Brown?"	"Remember the night you layblowed little Sadie down?"""
0	1823	11527	"""Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,"	I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
0	1824	11528	First degree and second degree 	"Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"""
0	1825	11529	Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,	They put me on a train and they brought me back,
0	1826	11530	Had no one to go my bail,	Crammed me back into the county jail.
1	1827	11531	Judge and jury took their stand,	Judge had the papers in his hand 
0	1828	11532	Fortyone days, fortyone nights,	Fortyone years to wear the ball and the stripes.
0	1829	11533	One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone	Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
0	1830	11534	I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,	And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
0	1831	11535	"I humbled myself to her beauty: ""Fair maiden, where do you belong?"	"Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"""
0	1832	11536	"""Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor"	And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
0	1833	11537	Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil	"And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."""
0	1834	11538	"""Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,"	I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
0	1835	11539	I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,	"For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."""
1	1836	11540	Since you've been gone,	I've been walking around
0	1837	11541	With my head bowed down to my shoes,	I've been living the blues every night without you.
1	1838	11542	I don't have to go far	To know where you are 
0	1839	11543	Strangers all give me the news,	I've been living the blues every night without you.
1	1840	11544	I think that it's best	I soon get some rest
1	1841	11545	And forget my pride,	But I can't deny
0	1842	11546	This feeling that I	Carry for you deep down inside.
0	1843	11547	If you'd see me this away,	You'd come back and you'd stay 
0	1844	11548	Oh, how could you refuse?	I've been living the blues every night without you.
1	1845	11549	I think that it's best	I soon get some rest
1	1846	11550	And forget my pride,	But I can't deny
0	1847	11551	This feeling that I	Carry for you deep down inside.
0	1848	11552	If you'd see me this way,	You'd come back and you'd stay 
0	1849	11553	Oh, how could you refuse?	I've been living the blues every night without you,
1	1850	11554	I've been living the blues every night without you,	I've been living the blues every night without you.
0	1851	11555	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	1852	11556	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall""  you thought they were all kidding you."
0	1853	11557	You usedbe so proud	About everybody that was hanging out;
1	1854	11558	Now you don't talk so loud,	Now you don't act soso proud
0	1855	11559	About having to be ascrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal 	How does it feel,
1	1856	11560	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	1857	11561	To bedirection home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	1858	11562	Like a rolling stone?	You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
0	1859	11563	But you know you only used to get juiced in it,	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
0	1860	11564	And now you're betteryou're gonna have to get used to it.	You said you'd never compromise
0	1861	11565	With the mystery tramp, but nowbuthis eye	Into the vacuum of his eyes
0	1862	11566	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes	"And say, ""Dowould you like tocome on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"""
1	1863	11567	How does it feel,	How does it feel,
1	1864	11568	To be without a home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	1865	11569	With no direction home,	Like a rolling stone?
0	1866	11570	Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,	Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
0	1867	11571	Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,	But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
0	1868	11572	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 
0	1869	11573	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:	When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose 
0	1870	11574	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel,
1	1871	11575	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	1872	11576	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
1	1873	11577	Just like a rolling stone,	Like a rolling stone,
1	1874	11578	Just like a rolling stone,	Like a rolling stone?
0	1875	11579	Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,	Fill it with newmade corn mash and never more you'll toil,
0	1876	11580	You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,	Watch them jugs afilling in the pale moonlight.
0	1877	11581	Build you a fire with hickory  hickory, ash, and oak,	Don't use no green or rotten wood  they'll get you by the smoke,
0	1878	11582	We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,	Watch them jugs afilling in the pale moonlight.
0	1879	11583	My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,	We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.

0	1887	11591	And it seems like I've gotta travel on.	That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,

0	1891	11595	And it seems like I want to travel on.	There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight acoming through the town:
0	1892	11596	I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.	A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town

0	1895	11599	Blue moon, you saw me standing alone	Without a dream in my heart,
0	1896	11600	Without a love of my own.	Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
0	1897	11601	You heard me saying a prayer for	Someone I really could care for.
0	1898	11602	And suddenly there appeared before me	The only one my arms could ever hold,
0	1899	11603	"I heard someone whisper, ""Please adore me,"""	And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
0	1900	11604	Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone	Without a dream in my heart,
1	1901	11605	Without a love of my own,	Without a love of my own.
0	1902	11606	am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,	I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
0	1903	11607	All lies and jest;	Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
0	1904	11608	And disregards the rest.	When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
0	1905	11609	In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,	Laying low,
0	1906	11610	Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,	Looking for the places only they would know.
0	1907	11611	Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,	But I get no offers, just a comeon from the whores on 7th avenue 
0	1908	11612	I do declare	There were times when I was so lonesome
0	1909	11613	I took some comfort there.	Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
0	1910	11614	Going home,	Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
0	1911	11615	Leading me, going home.	In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
0	1912	11616	And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out	In his anger and his shame,
0	1913	11617	"""I am leaving, I am leaving!"""	But the fighter still remains.
0	1914	11618	Well, everybody's building their boats,	Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
0	1915	11619	Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
0	1916	11620	Oh, come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

0	1919	11623	Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
0	1920	11624	Well, come all without, come all within,	Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

0	1924	11628	Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.	Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
0	1925	11629	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!	Whoa, come all without, come all within,
0	1926	11630	Why must you always try to make me over?	Take me as I am or let me go.
0	1927	11631	White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,	Take me as I am or let me go.
0	1928	11632	You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,	In the image of someone you used to know,
0	1929	11633	But I won't be a standin for an old love,	Take me as I am or let me go.
0	1930	11634	You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,	Take me as I am or let me go.
0	1931	11635	If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:	Take me as I am or let me go.
0	1932	11636	You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,	In the image of someone you used to know,
0	1933	11637	But I won't be a standin for an old love,	Take me as I am or let me go.
1	1934	11638	Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,	Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam

0	1990	11694	Winter would have no spring,	I couldn't hear the robin sing,
1	1991	11695	I just wouldn't have a clue,	Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
1	1992	11696	If not for you,	If not for you,
1	1993	11697	If not for you,	If not for you,
0	1994	11698	Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,	The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
0	1995	11699	There was little to say, there was no conversation	As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
0	1996	11700	And the locusts sang off in the distance,	Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
0	1997	11701	Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,	Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
0	1998	11702	I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,	Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
0	1999	11703	I was ready to leave, I was already walking,	But the next time I looked there was light in the room
0	2000	11704	And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,	Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
0	2001	11705	Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,	Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
0	2002	11706	Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,	The weather was hot, anearly ninety degrees,
0	2003	11707	The man standing next to me, his head was exploding 	Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
1	2004	11708	Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,	Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
0	2005	11709	Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,	And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
0	2006	11710	I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,	Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
0	2007	11711	Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota 	Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
0	2008	11712	And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,	Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
0	2009	11713	And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,	Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
0	2010	11714	Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,	We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
0	2011	11715	Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream 	Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
0	2012	11716	Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and goodlooking,	We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
0	2013	11717	Staring out the window to the stars high above 	Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
1	2014	11718	Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,	Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
0	2015	11719	Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,	Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
0	2016	11720	Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,	Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
0	2017	11721	Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day	Time passes slowly and fades away.
0	2018	11722	I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,	"He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, ""Well, well, well."""
0	2019	11723	His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.	"""How are you?"" he said to me, I said it back to him."
0	2020	11724	I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,	A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
0	2021	11725	"""Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,"	Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror 
0	2022	11726	"He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"""	Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
0	2023	11727	I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.	I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
0	2024	11728	The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone	And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
0	2025	11729	So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,	From the little Minnesota town.
1	2026	11730	Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,	Winterlude by the road tonight,
0	2027	11731	Tonight there will be no quarreling,	Everything is gonna be alright.
0	2028	11732	Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,	You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
1	2029	11733	Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,	Winterlude by the corn in the field,
0	2030	11734	Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,	Then come back and cook up a meal.
0	2031	11735	Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,	The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
0	2032	11736	Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,	Winterlude by the telephone wire,
0	2033	11737	Winterlude, it's making me lazy,	Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
0	2034	11738	The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,	Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
0	2035	11739	If dogs run free, why not we	Across the swooping plain?
0	2036	11740	My ears hear a symphony	Of two mules, trains, and rain.
0	2037	11741	The best is always yet to come  that's what they explain to me,	Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
1	2038	11742	If dogs run free, why not me	Across the swamp of time?
1	2039	11743	My mind weaves a symphony	And tapestry of rhyme.
0	2040	11744	Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,	To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
0	2041	11745	If dogs run free, then what must be	Must be and that is all.
0	2042	11746	True love can make a blade of grass	Stand up straight and tall,
0	2043	11747	In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:	It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
0	2044	11748	Can't you hear that rooster crowing?	Rabbit running down across the road,
0	2045	11749	Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,	So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
1	2046	11750	On this new morning, new morning,	On this new morning with you.
0	2047	11751	Can't you hear that motor turning?	Automobile coming into style,
0	2048	11752	Coming down the road for a country mile or two,	So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
1	2049	11753	On this new morning, new morning,	On this new morning with you.
0	2050	11754	The night passed away so quickly,	It always does when you're with me.
0	2051	11755	Can't you feel that sun ashining?	Groundhog running by the country stream,
0	2052	11756	This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,	So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
1	2053	11757	On this new morning, new morning,	On this new morning with you.

0	2080	11784	Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.	Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
0	2081	11785	I think to myself I might not take it anymore 	Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
0	2082	11786	But, oh, what a wonderful feeling	Just to know that you are near,
0	2083	11787	It sets my aheart areeling	From my toes up to my ears.
0	2084	11788	The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,	But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine 
0	2085	11789	Three angels up above the street,	Each one playing a horn,
0	2086	11790	Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,	They've been there since Christmas morn.
0	2087	11791	The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,	Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
0	2088	11792	One UHaul trailer, a truck with no wheels,	The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
0	2089	11793	The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,	A man with a badge skips by,
0	2090	11794	Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,	Nobody stops to ask why.
0	2091	11795	The bakery truck stops outside of that fence	Where the angels stand high on the poles,
0	2092	11796	The driver peeks out, trying to find one face	In this concrete world full of souls.
0	2093	11797	The angels play on their horns all day,	The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
0	2094	11798	But does anyone hear the music they play?	Does anyone even try?
1	2095	11799	Father of night, father of day,	Father who taketh the darkness away,
0	2096	11800	Father who teacheth the bird to fly,	Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
1	2097	11801	Father of loneliness and pain,	Father of love and father of rain.
1	2098	11802	Father of day, father of night,	Father of black, father of white,
0	2099	11803	Father who build the mountain so high,	Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
0	2100	11804	Father of time and father of dreams,	Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
1	2101	11805	Father of grain, father of wheat,	Father of cold and father of heat,
0	2102	11806	Father of air and father of trees,	Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
0	2103	11807	Father of minutes, father of days,	Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
0	2104	11808	What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,	Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this allnight cafe.
0	2105	11809	Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow	To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
0	2106	11810	Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand	With the sun beating down over the chimneytops and the one I love so close at hand.
0	2107	11811	If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,	But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
0	2108	11812	People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,	Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
0	2109	11813	Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,	No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
0	2110	11814	And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.	People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
0	2111	11815	Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was areally shook;	Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
0	2112	11816	No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow	And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
1	2113	11817	Watch the river flow,	Watching the river flow,
0	2114	11818	Watching the river flow,	But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
0	2115	11819	Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	If'n you don't know by now.
0	2116	11820	And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 	It'll never do, somehow.
0	2117	11821	When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,	Look out your window and I'll be gone.
0	2118	11822	You're the reason I'm traveling on,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2119	11823	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,	The light I never knowed.
0	2120	11824	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe 	I'm on the dark side of the road.
0	2121	11825	But I wish there was something you would do or say	To try and make me change my mind and stay.
0	2122	11826	But we never did too much talking, anyway.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2123	11827	So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,	Like you never done before.
0	2124	11828	And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal 	I can't hear you anymore.
0	2125	11829	I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.	I once loved a woman  a child, I am told.
0	2126	11830	I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2127	11831	So long, honey babe.	Where I'm bound I can't tell.
0	2128	11832	Goodbye's too good a word, babe,	"So I'll just say ""Fare thee well""."
0	2129	11833	I ain't saying you treated me unkind.	You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
0	2130	11834	You just kinda wasted my precious time,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
1	2131	11835	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	2132	11836	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
0	2133	11837	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	2134	11838	Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but hishis hands are clean
0	2135	11839	And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	2136	11840	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it too.
0	2137	11841	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
0	2138	11842	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
1	2139	11843	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach for you in the night.
0	2140	11844	Oh, the ragman draws circles up and down the block.	I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
0	2141	11845	And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,	But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
0	2142	11846	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2143	11847	Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells	Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
0	2144	11848	And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,	But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
0	2145	11849	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2146	11850	Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.	She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
0	2147	11851	"And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met"	"And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."""
0	2148	11852	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2149	11853	Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,	But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
0	2150	11854	But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control	When Ihe built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
0	2151	11855	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2152	11856	Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,	Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
0	2153	11857	And me, I nearly got busted  and wouldn't it be my luck	To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
0	2154	11858	Oh, mama, is this really the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2155	11859	Now, the teenpreacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed	With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
0	2156	11860	"But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, ""Not even you can hide."	"You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."""
0	2157	11861	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2158	11862	"Now, the rainman gave me two cures, then he said, ""Jump right in."""	The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
0	2159	11863	And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind	And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
0	2160	11864	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2161	11865	When Ruthie says come see her in her honkytonk lagoon,	Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
0	2162	11866	"And I say, ""Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."""	"And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."""
0	2163	11867	Oh, mama, can this really be the end,	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2164	11868	Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.	They all fall there so perfectly  it all seems so welltimed.
0	2165	11869	And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price	You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
0	2166	11870	Oh, mama, is this really the end,	To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	2167	11871	Close your eyes, close the door.	You don't have to worry any more.
0	2168	11872	I'll be your baby tonight.	Shut the light, shut the shade.
0	2169	11873	You don't have to be afraid.	I'll be your baby tonight.
0	2170	11874	Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  we're gonna forget it.	That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
0	2171	11875	Kick your shoes off, do not fear.	Bring that bottle over here.
0	2172	11876	I ain't looking to compete with you,	Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
1	2173	11877	Simplify you, classify you,	Deny, defy, or crucify you.
0	2174	11878	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
0	2175	11879	No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,	Frighten you or uptighten you,
1	2176	11880	Drag you down or drain you down,	Chain you down or bring you down.
0	2177	11881	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	2178	11882	I ain't looking to block you up,	Shock or knock or lock you up,
1	2179	11883	Analyze you, categorize you,	Finalize you or advertise you.
0	2180	11884	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
0	2181	11885	I don't wanna straightface you,	Race or chase you, track or trace you,
1	2182	11886	Or disgrace you or displace you,	Or define you or confine you.
0	2183	11887	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	2184	11888	I don't wanna meet your kin,	Make you spin or do you in,
1	2185	11889	Or select you or dissect you,	Or inspect you or reject you.
0	2186	11890	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	2187	11891	I don't wanna fake you out,	Take or shake or forsake you out,
0	2188	11892	I ain't looking for you to feel like me,	See like me or be like me.
0	2189	11893	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
0	2190	11894	Crimson flames tied through my ears,	Rolling, highandmighty traps
0	2191	11895	Pounced with fire on flaming roads,	Using ideas as my maps.
0	2192	11896	"""We'll meet on edges soon,"" said I,"	Proud 'neath heated brow.
0	2193	11897	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	2194	11898	Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth.	"""Rip down all hate!"" I screamed."
0	2195	11899	Lies that life is blackandwhite	Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
0	2196	11900	Romantic facts of musketeers	Foundationed deep somehow.
0	2197	11901	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	2198	11902	Girls' faces formed the forward path	From phony jealousy
1	2199	11903	To memorizing politics	Of ancient history,
0	2200	11904	Flung down by corpse evangelists,	Unthought of, though, somehow.
0	2201	11905	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	2202	11906	A selfordained professor's tongue,	Too serious to fool,
0	2203	11907	Spouted out that liberty	Is just equality in school.
0	2204	11908	"""Equality"". I spoke the word"	As if a wedding vow.
0	2205	11909	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	2206	11910	In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand	At the mongrel dogs who teach,
0	2207	11911	Fearing not I'd become my enemy	In the instant that I preach,
0	2208	11912	My existence led by confusion boats,	Mutiny from stern to bow.
0	2209	11913	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
0	2210	11914	Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,	Too noble to neglect,
0	2211	11915	Deceived me into thinking	I had something to protect.
0	2212	11916	Good and bad, I define these terms	Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
0	2213	11917	Ah, but I was so much older then,	I'm younger than that now.
1	2214	11918	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	2215	11919	Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.	I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
0	2216	11920	It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	2217	11921	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
0	2218	11922	Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.	He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
0	2219	11923	Then he fines you every time you slam the door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
1	2220	11924	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
0	2221	11925	Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,	His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
0	2222	11926	The National Guard stands around his door.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
1	2223	11927	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,	No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
0	2224	11928	Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,	Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
0	2225	11929	She's 68, but she says she's 54.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
1	2226	11930	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	2227	11931	Well, I try my best to be just like I am,	But everybody wants you to be just like them.
0	2228	11932	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave and I just get bored."	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	2229	11933	Throw my ticket out the window.	Throw my suitcase out there too.
0	2230	11934	Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
0	2231	11935	I should have left this town this morning,	But it was more than I could do.
0	2232	11936	Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long	For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
0	2233	11937	Is it really any wonder,	The love that a stranger might receive?
0	2234	11938	You cast your spell and I went under.	I find it so difficult to leave.
1	2235	11939	I can hear that whistle blowing.	I see that stationmaster too.
0	2236	11940	If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
1	2237	11941	Throw my ticket out the window.	Throw my suitcase out there too.
0	2238	11942	Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore	'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
1	2239	11943	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,	She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
0	2240	11944	She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
0	2241	11945	You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,	But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
1	2242	11946	She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,	She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
0	2243	11947	She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.	She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
0	2244	11948	She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,	She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
1	2245	11949	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,	Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
0	2246	11950	"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."
0	2247	11951	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
0	2248	11952	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
0	2249	11953	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."""
0	2250	11954	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
0	2251	11955	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
0	2252	11956	Well, everybody's building their boats,	Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
0	2253	11957	Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
0	2254	11958	Oh, come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	2255	11959	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	2256	11960	Whoa! andwell, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,	But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
0	2257	11961	Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
0	2258	11962	Well, come all without, come all within,	Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	2259	11963	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	2260	11964	Play that guitar now!	Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, II can recite them all,
0	2261	11965	Tell me where it ahurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.	Nobody can get any sleep  you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
0	2262	11966	Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.	Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
0	2263	11967	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!	Whoa, come all without, come all within,
0	2264	11968	When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Eastertime too	And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
0	2265	11969	Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,	They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
0	2266	11970	"Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her ""Thanks a lot"","	I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
0	2267	11971	I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot	And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
0	2268	11972	"Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the ""Goddess of Gloom"","	She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
0	2269	11973	And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon	As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
0	2270	11974	Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,	You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
0	2271	11975	If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came	Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
0	2272	11976	Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast	How they blackmailed the sergeantatarms into leaving his post
0	2273	11977	And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,	Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
0	2274	11978	I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,	Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
0	2275	11979	But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.	I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
1	2276	11980	Oh, where have you been, my blueeyed son?	And where have you been, my darling young one?
0	2277	11981	I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,	I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
0	2278	11982	I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,	I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
0	2279	11983	I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	2280	11984	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	Oh, what did you see, my blueeyed son?
0	2281	11985	And what did you see, my darling young one?	I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
0	2282	11986	I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,	I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
0	2283	11987	I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,	I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
0	2284	11988	I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,	I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
0	2285	11989	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
1	2286	11990	What did you hear, my blueeyed son?	And what did you hear, my darling young one?
0	2287	11991	I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,	I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
0	2288	11992	I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,	I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
0	2289	11993	I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,	I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
0	2290	11994	I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	2291	11995	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	Oh, what did you meet, my blueeyed son?
0	2292	11996	And who did you meet, my darling young one?	I met a young child beside a dead pony,
0	2293	11997	I met a white man who walked a black dog,	I met a young woman whose body was burning,
0	2294	11998	I met a young girl  she gave me a rainbow,	I met one man who was wounded in love,
0	2295	11999	I met another man who was wounded in hatred,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
0	2296	12000	It's a hard rain's gonna fall.	And what'll you do now, my blueeyed son?
0	2297	12001	And what'll you do now, my darling young one?	I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
0	2298	12002	I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,	Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
0	2299	12003	Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,	Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
0	2300	12004	And the executioner's face is always wellhidden,	Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
0	2301	12005	Where black is the color, where none is the number,	And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
0	2302	12006	And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,	And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
0	2303	12007	But I'll know my song well before I start singing,	And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
0	2304	12008	If not for you,	Babe, I couldn't find the door,
1	2305	12009	Couldn't even see the floor,	I'd be sad and blue,
1	2306	12010	If not for you.	If not for you,
0	2307	12011	Babe, I'd lay awake all night,	Wait for the morning light
1	2308	12012	To shine in through,	But it would not be new,
1	2309	12013	If not for you.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
0	2310	12014	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
0	2311	12015	I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
0	2312	12016	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
0	2313	12017	Oh, what would I do if not for you?	If not for you,
0	2314	12018	Winter would have no spring,	I couldn't hear the robin sing,
1	2315	12019	I just wouldn't have a clue,	Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
1	2316	12020	If not for you,	If not for you,
1	2317	12021	If not for you,	If not for you,
0	2318	12022	You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,	But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
0	2319	12023	Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,	Crying like a fire in the sun.
0	2320	12024	Look out, the saints are coming through	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	2321	12025	The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,	Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
0	2322	12026	The emptyhanded painter from your streets	Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
0	2323	12027	The sky too is folding under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	2324	12028	All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,	Your own emptyhanded army is all going home,
0	2325	12029	Your lover, who just walked out your door,	Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
0	2326	12030	The carpet too is moving under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	2327	12031	Leave your steppingstones behind, there's something that calls for you,	Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
0	2328	12032	The vagabond who's rapping at your door	Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
0	2329	12033	Strike another match, go start anew,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
1	2330	12034	If today was not a crooked highway,	If tonight was not a crooked trail,
0	2331	12035	If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,	"Then ""lonesome"" would mean nothing to you at all."
0	2332	12036	Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,	If I could hear her heart asoftly pounding,
0	2333	12037	Yes, and only if she was lying by me,	I'd lie in my bed once again.
0	2334	12038	I can't see my reflection in the water,	I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
0	2335	12039	I can't hear the echo of my footsteps	Or remember the sounds of my own name.
0	2336	12040	Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting	And if I could only hear her heart asoftly pounding,
0	2337	12041	Yes, and only if she was lying by me,	Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
1	2338	12042	There's beauty in that silver, singing river,	There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
0	2339	12043	But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty	That I remember in my true love's eyes.
0	2340	12044	Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,	If I could only hear her heart asoftly pounding,
0	2341	12045	Yes, and only if she was lying by me 	And I'd lie in my bed once again.
0	2342	12046	Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,	Ancient footprints are everywhere,
0	2343	12047	You could almost think that you're seeing double	On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
0	2344	12048	Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,	Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece 
0	2345	12049	Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me	When I paint my masterpiece.
0	2346	12050	Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,	Dodging lions and wasting time.
0	2347	12051	Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em 	Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
0	2348	12052	Train wheels running through the back of my memory	As the daylight hours do increase,
0	2349	12053	Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody	When I paint my masterpiece.
0	2350	12054	I left Rome and landed in Brussels	With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
0	2351	12055	Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,	Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
0	2352	12056	Newspapermen eating candy,	Had to be held down by big police;
0	2353	12057	Someday, everything is gonna be different	When I paint my masterpiece.
1	2354	12058	They say every man must need protection,	They say every man must fall,
0	2355	12059	Yet I swear I see my reflection	Some place so high above the wall.
0	2356	12060	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	2357	12061	Down here next to me in this lonely crowd	There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
0	2358	12062	All day long I hear him cry so loud,	Calling out that he's been framed.
0	2359	12063	Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	2360	12064	"Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called ""Gunga Din"" "	Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't agoing nowhere!
0	2361	12065	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
0	2362	12066	Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:	"""We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."""
0	2363	12067	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
0	2364	12068	Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,	Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
0	2365	12069	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
0	2366	12070	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's agonna come!	Oohee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
0	2367	12071	Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,	Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
0	2368	12072	You can train on down to Williams Point,	You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
0	2369	12073	But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,	You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
0	2370	12074	Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,	There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
0	2371	12075	Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,	It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
0	2372	12076	Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,	You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
0	2373	12077	Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,	Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
0	2374	12078	Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,	If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
0	2375	12079	Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?	You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
0	2376	12080	There's guns across the river aiming at you,	Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
0	2377	12081	Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you 	Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
0	2378	12082	Camping out all night on the veranda,	Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
0	2379	12083	Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you 	Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
0	2380	12084	Playing around with some sweet senorita,	Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
0	2381	12085	To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you 	Billy, you're so far away from home.
0	2382	12086	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
0	2383	12087	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	2384	12088	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	2385	12089	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	2386	12090	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
0	2387	12091	That long, black cloud is coming down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	2388	12092	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	2389	12093	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	2390	12094	There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,	There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
0	2391	12095	Bounty hunters are dancing all around you 	Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
0	2392	12096	Camping out all night on the veranda,	Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
0	2393	12097	Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you 	Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
0	2394	12098	There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,	Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
0	2395	12099	There's always one more notch in four more aces,	Billy, and you're playing all alone.
0	2396	12100	Playing around with some sweet senorita,	Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
0	2397	12101	In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,	Billy, and you're going all alone.
0	2398	12102	They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,	So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
0	2399	12103	If every little sound just might be thunder,	Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
0	2400	12104	There's always another stranger sneaking glances,	Some triggerhappy fool willing to take chances,
0	2401	12105	Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,	Advances on your spirit and your soul.
0	2402	12106	The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,	So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
0	2403	12107	Billy, don't it make you feel so lowdown	To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
0	2404	12108	So, hang on to your woman if you've got one 	Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
0	2405	12109	I'll be in Santa Fe about one 	Billy, you been running for so long.
0	2406	12110	Gypsy queens will play your grand finale	Way down in some Tularosa alley,
0	2407	12111	Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley 	Billy, you're so far away from home,
1	2408	12112	Billy, you're so far away from home,	Billy, you're so far away from home.
0	2409	12113	Spend the night with some sweet senorita,	Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
0	2410	12114	In some lonesome shadow she might greet you 	Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
0	2411	12115	They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,	Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
0	2412	12116	Every little sound just might be thunder,	Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
0	2413	12117	Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow	Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
0	2414	12118	Spending the time that you borrowed,	Figuring a way to get back home.
0	2415	12119	When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,	A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
0	2416	12120	Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.	The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
0	2417	12121	I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,	But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
0	2418	12122	She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.	Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
0	2419	12123	Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree	Conversing with my Flora there  it seemed so strange to me 
0	2420	12124	And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.	I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
0	2421	12125	I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,	And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
0	2422	12126	Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast 	All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
0	2423	12127	I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,	They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
0	2424	12128	Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,	Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
0	2425	12129	Wise men say only fools rush in,	But I can't help falling in love with you.
0	2426	12130	Shall I stay, would it be a sin	If I can't help falling in love with you?
0	2427	12131	Like a river flows surely to the sea,	Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
0	2428	12132	Take my hand, take amy whole life, too,	For I can't help falling in love with you.
0	2429	12133	Like a river flows surely to the sea,	Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
0	2430	12134	Take my hand, take amy whole life, too,	For I can't help falling in love with you.
0	2431	12135	I got a wife and five little children,	I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
0	2432	12136	Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,	Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
0	2433	12137	The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,	The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
0	2434	12138	Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,	Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
0	2435	12139	The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.	The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
0	2436	12140	Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,	Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
0	2437	12141	The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,	My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
0	2438	12142	Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,	Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
0	2439	12143	I got a wife and five little children,	I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
0	2440	12144	Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,	Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
0	2441	12145	Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell	About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
0	2442	12146	From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,	They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizonaland.
0	2443	12147	Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed	Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
0	2444	12148	Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,	But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
0	2445	12149	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
0	2446	12150	"Yes, call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
0	2447	12151	They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,	But only twentyseven lived to walk back down that hill again
0	2448	12152	And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,	One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
0	2449	12153	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
0	2450	12154	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
0	2451	12155	Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,	He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
0	2452	12156	But he was just a Pima Indian  no money, no crops, no chance 	And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
0	2453	12157	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
0	2454	12158	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
0	2455	12159	And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home 	They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
0	2456	12160	He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,	Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
0	2457	12161	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
0	2458	12162	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
0	2459	12163	"Yes, call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry"	And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
0	2460	12164	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
0	2461	12165	"Call him ""Drunken"" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,"	Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
0	2462	12166	I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in wornout shoes 	Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
0	2463	12167	He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.	Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
0	2464	12168	I met him in a cell in New Orleans  I was down and out,	He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
0	2465	12169	He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.	Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
0	2466	12170	He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,	He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
0	2467	12171	He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.	Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
0	2468	12172	He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,	He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
0	2469	12173	His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.	Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
0	2470	12174	"He said, ""I dance now at every chance at honkytonks for drinks and tips,"	"But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."""
0	2471	12175	"He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, ""Please,"	Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
1	2472	12176	Dance!	"Mr. Bojangles, dance!"""
1	2473	12177	Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,	Fare thee well but for a while,
0	2474	12178	The ship is waiting and the wind blows high	And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
1	2475	12179	Ten thousand miles away from home,	Ten thousand miles or more 
0	2476	12180	The sea may freeze and the earth may burn	If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
0	2477	12181	Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?	She'll surely turn to white,
0	2478	12182	If ever I prove false to you,	Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
0	2479	12183	Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two	And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
1	2480	12184	I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,	Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
0	2481	12185	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,	A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
0	2482	12186	Don't it always go to show	You never know what you got till it's gone?
0	2483	12187	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.	They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
0	2484	12188	They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.	Don't it always go to show
0	2485	12189	You never know what you got till it's gone?	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
0	2486	12190	Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,	Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
0	2487	12191	Don't it always ago to show	You never know what you got till it's gone?
0	2488	12192	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.	Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
0	2489	12193	A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.	Don't it always ago to show
0	2490	12194	You never know what you got till it's gone?	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
1	2491	12195	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,	They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
0	2492	12196	Now and then there's a fool such as I.	Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,

0	2501	12205	Broke her heart, lost my own,	Adios, mi corazon.
0	2502	12206	Spanish is the loving tongue,	Soft as music, light as spring.
0	2503	12207	It was a girl I learned it from,	Living down Sonora way.
0	2504	12208	Well, I don't look much like a lover,	Still I say her lovewords over
1	2505	12209	Mostly when I'm all alone,	Mi amor, mi corazon.
0	2506	12210	Haven't seen her since that night 	I can't cross the line, you know,
0	2507	12211	They want me for a gambling fight.	Like as not, it's better so,
0	2508	12212	Still I've always kind of missed her	Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
0	2509	12213	Broke her heart, lost my own,	Adios, mi corazon,
0	2510	12214	Broke her heart, lost my own,	Adios, mi corazon,
0	2511	12215	On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,	Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
0	2512	12216	We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,	It sure is right on a night like this.
0	2513	12217	On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,	Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
0	2514	12218	Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,	It sure feels right on a night like this.
0	2515	12219	On a night like this I can't get any sleep,	The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
0	2516	12220	Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,	And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
0	2517	12221	Put your body next to mine and keep me company,	There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
0	2518	12222	Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door 	If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
0	2519	12223	There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,	But it sure feels right on a night like this.
0	2520	12224	I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend 	There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
0	2521	12225	I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.	I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
0	2522	12226	And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,	I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
0	2523	12227	I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,	Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
0	2524	12228	So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.	"Grandma said, ""Boy, go and follow your heart"
0	2525	12229	And you'll be fine at the end of the line:	All that's gold doesn't shine,
0	2526	12230	"Don't you and your one true love ever part."""	I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
0	2527	12231	Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,	So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
0	2528	12232	Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,	I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
0	2529	12233	Sister's on the highway with that steeldriving crew,	Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
0	2530	12234	Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?	Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
0	2531	12235	It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.	Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
0	2532	12236	You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,	Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
0	2533	12237	Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,	Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
0	2534	12238	Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,	Lone Wolf went out drinking  that was over pretty fast,
0	2535	12239	Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.	Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
0	2536	12240	I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.	Today on the countryside it was ahotter than a crotch,
0	2537	12241	I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch 	Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
0	2538	12242	I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,	I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
0	2539	12243	Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,	I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite 
0	2540	12244	Hazel, dirtyblonde hair,	I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
0	2541	12245	You got something I want plenty of,	Ooh, a little touch of your love.
0	2542	12246	Hazel, stardust in your eye,	You're going somewhere and so am I,
0	2543	12247	I'd give you the sky high above,	Ooh, for the touch of your love.
0	2544	12248	Oh, no, I don't need any reminder	To know how much I really care,
0	2545	12249	But it's just making me blinder and blinder	Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
0	2546	12250	Hazel, you called and I came,	Now, don't make me play this waitinggame.
0	2547	12251	You got something I want plenty of,	Ooh, a little touch of your love.
0	2548	12252	Something there is about you that strikes a match in me 	Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
0	2549	12253	Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,	Something that's crossed over from another century?
0	2550	12254	Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth 	Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
0	2551	12255	There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.	Something there is about you that brings back a longforgotten truth.
0	2552	12256	Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,	Don't have to look no further  you're the soul of many things.
0	2553	12257	I could say that I'd be faithful  I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,	But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
0	2554	12258	Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.	I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
0	2555	12259	My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,	Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
0	2556	12260	May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,	May you always do for others and let others do for you.
0	2557	12261	May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,	May you stay forever young,
1	2558	12262	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
0	2559	12263	May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,	May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
0	2560	12264	May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,	And may you stay forever young,
1	2561	12265	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
0	2562	12266	May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,	May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
0	2563	12267	May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,	And may you stay forever young,
1	2564	12268	Forever young, forever young,	May you stay forever young.
0	2565	12269	May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,	May you always do for others and let others do for you.
0	2566	12270	May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung	And may you stay forever young,
0	2567	12271	May you stay forever young.	May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
0	2568	12272	May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.	May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
1	2569	12273	And may you stay forever young,	May you stay forever young.
0	2570	12274	May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,	May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
0	2571	12275	May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung	And may you stay forever young,
0	2572	12276	I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,	You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
0	2573	12277	The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,	I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
0	2574	12278	I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed	And the mercy that you showed to me  who ever would have guessed?
0	2575	12279	I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,	That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
0	2576	12280	Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,	Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
0	2577	12281	Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame	All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
0	2578	12282	There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:	In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
0	2579	12283	The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,	I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
0	2580	12284	I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me	'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
0	2581	12285	We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break 	No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
0	2582	12286	So, sing your praise of progress and of the doommachine,	The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
0	2583	12287	Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,	I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
0	2584	12288	You angel, you, you're as fgot me under your wing,	The way you walk and the way you talk  I feel I could almost sing.
0	2585	12289	You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,	I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
0	2586	12290	And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,	Yes, I never did feel this way before,
0	2587	12291	Never did get up and walk the floor,	If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
0	2588	12292	You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,	The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
0	2589	12293	And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,	Never did feel this way before,
0	2590	12294	Never did get up and walk the floor,	If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
0	2591	12295	You angel, you, you got me under your wing,	The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
0	2592	12296	Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break	On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
1	2593	12297	You're beautiful beyond words,	You're beautiful to me,
0	2594	12298	You could make me cry, never say goodbye,	Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
0	2595	12299	With a big bouquet of the roses	Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
0	2596	12300	The crashing waves roll over me	As I stand upon the sand
0	2597	12301	And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.	Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
0	2598	12302	You'll change your last name, too,	You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
0	2599	12303	I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,	I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
0	2600	12304	Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,	I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
0	2601	12305	Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,	I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
0	2602	12306	To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun 	I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
0	2603	12307	You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,	When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
0	2604	12308	Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole 	I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
0	2605	12309	You gave me babies, one, two, three  what is more? you saved my life,	Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
0	2606	12310	My thoughts of you don't ever rest  they'd kill me if I lie,	But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
0	2607	12311	The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,	We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
0	2608	12312	What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,	But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
0	2609	12313	It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,	Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
0	2610	12314	'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend	And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
0	2611	12315	Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side	And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
0	2612	12316	You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,	And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
0	2613	12317	You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,	Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
0	2614	12318	And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,	'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
0	2615	12319	You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,	You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
1	2616	12320	I just can't do what I've done before,	I just can't beg you anymore,
1	2617	12321	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	2618	12322	Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	2619	12323	You say you're shaking and you're always abreaking, but you know how hard you try,	You say you're assuming that you're kind of ahurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
0	2620	12324	Sometimes it gets so hard to care 	It can't be this way everywhere 
1	2621	12325	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	2622	12326	Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	2623	12327	The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,	But he's badlybuilt and he walks on stilts  watch out he don't fall on you.
0	2624	12328	You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,	Say you got some otherother kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
0	2625	12329	You say my kisses aren't like his 	Yeah, andwell, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
1	2626	12330	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	2627	12331	Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
1	2628	12332	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	2629	12333	Whatever colors you have ain your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
0	2630	12334	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
0	2631	12335	Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but his ahands are clean
0	2632	12336	And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 
0	2633	12337	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it, too.
0	2634	12338	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
0	2635	12339	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
0	2636	12340	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night 
0	2637	12341	They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,	Stone you when you're walking on the path,
0	2638	12342	They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,	Stone you when you're walking on the street,
0	2639	12343	Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone	Because everybody must get stoned.
1	2640	12344	They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,	Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
1	2641	12345	They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,	Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
0	2642	12346	But I wouldn't feel too all alone	Because everybody must get stoned.
1	2643	12347	They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,	Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
1	2644	12348	They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,	Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
0	2645	12349	But I wouldn't feel too all alone	Because everybody must get stoned.
1	2646	12350	They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,	They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
0	2647	12351	They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,	Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
0	2648	12352	But I wouldn't feel too all alone	Because everybody must get stoned.
0	2649	12353	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
0	2650	12354	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	2651	12355	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	2652	12356	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	2653	12357	Mama, wipe the blood from my face,	I'm sick and tired of the war.
0	2654	12358	Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,	Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	2655	12359	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	2656	12360	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	2657	12361	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
0	2658	12362	That long, black train is pulling on down,	Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	2659	12363	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	2660	12364	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	2661	12365	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
1	2662	12366	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'm not the one you need.
0	2663	12367	You say you're looking for someone	Never weak, but always strong,
0	2664	12368	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
0	2665	12369	Someone to open each and every door,	But it ain't me, babe,
0	2666	12370	No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	2667	12371	Move lightly from the ledge, babe,	Amove alightly on the ground.
0	2668	12372	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'll only let you down.
0	2669	12373	You say you're looking for someone	Who will promise never to part,
1	2670	12374	Someone to close his eyes for you,	Someone to close his heart,
0	2671	12375	Someone who will die for you and maybe more 	It still ain't me, babe,
0	2672	12376	No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	2673	12377	Go melt back into the night, babe,	Everything inside here is made of stone.
0	2674	12378	Athere's anothing in here that's amoving	And, anyway, I'm not alone.
0	2675	12379	You say you're looking for someone	Pick you up every time you fall,
0	2676	12380	Someone to gather flowers constantly,	And come every time you call,
0	2677	12381	A lover for your life  abut what more?	And it still ain't me, babe,
0	2678	12382	No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	2679	12383	You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,	"See somebody naked, you say, ""Who's that man?"""
0	2680	12384	You try so hard, but you don't understand	What you're gonna say when you get home
0	2681	12385	'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You raise up your head, say, ""Is this where it is?"""
0	2682	12386	"Somebody points to you and says, ""It's his."""	"You say, ""What's mine?"" Someone else says, ""Where what is?"""
0	2683	12387	"You say, ""Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"""	But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	2684	12388	You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,	Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
0	2685	12389	"Says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?"""	"You say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you the bone."
0	2686	12390	And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
0	2687	12391	To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.	No one has any respect, anyway they expect
0	2688	12392	You to give your check to taxdeductible charity organizations.	You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
0	2689	12393	With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,	You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
0	2690	12394	You're very wellread, it's wellknown.	But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	2691	12395	You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,	Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
0	2692	12396	There ought to be a law against you coming around,	You should be made to be wearing a telephone
1	2693	12397	They say everything can be replaced,	They say every distance is not near,
0	2694	12398	So I remember every face	Of every man who put me here.
0	2695	12399	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
1	2696	12400	They say every man needs protection,	They say that every man must fall,
0	2697	12401	Yet I swear I see my reflection	Somewhere so high above this wall.
0	2698	12402	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	2699	12403	Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,	A man who swears he's not to blame.
0	2700	12404	All day long I hear him shouting so loud,	Just crying out that he was framed.
0	2701	12405	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	2702	12406	Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	If'n you don't know by now,
0	2703	12407	It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	It don't matter, anyhow.
0	2704	12408	When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,	Look out your window and I'll be gone,
0	2705	12409	You're the reason I'm atraveling on,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2706	12410	Well, it ain't no use in aturning on your light, babe,	The light I never knowed,
0	2707	12411	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,	I'm on the dark side of the road.
0	2708	12412	Still, I wish there were something you would do or say	To try and make me change amy mind and stay,
0	2709	12413	But we never did too much talking anyway,	So don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2710	12414	Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,	Like you never did before,
0	2711	12415	And it ain't no use in acalling out my name, babe,	I can't hear you anymore.
0	2712	12416	I'm athinking and wondering, walking down the road,	I once loved a woman  a child, I'm told,
0	2713	12417	I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2714	12418	So, I'm awalking down that long, lonesome road, babe,	Where I'm bound I can't tell,
0	2715	12419	But goodbye's atoo good a word, babe,	"So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well."""
0	2716	12420	I ain't saying you treated me unkind,	You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
0	2717	12421	You just kinda wasted my precious time,	But don't think twice, it's alright.
0	2718	12422	Anobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,	Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
0	2719	12423	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows	Have afallen from her curls.
1	2720	12424	Ashe takes just like a woman	And she aches just like a woman
0	2721	12425	And she wakes ajust like a woman,	Yeah, but she breaks ajust like a little girl.
0	2722	12426	Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,	Anobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
0	2723	12427	Till she sees finally that she's alike all the rest	In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
1	2724	12428	Ashe takes just like a woman	And she wakes just like a woman
1	2725	12429	And she aches just like a woman,	But she breaks ajust like a little girl.
0	2726	12430	It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this apain in here,
0	2727	12431	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I ajust don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
0	2728	12432	Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on athat you knew me when
0	2729	12433	I was ahungry and it was your world.	You take just like a woman
1	2730	12434	And you ache ajust like a woman	And you make love just like a woman,
1	2731	12435	Darkness at the break of noon	Shadows even the silver spoon,
0	2732	12436	The handmade blade, the child's balloon,	Eclipses both the sun and moon 
0	2733	12437	To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.	Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
0	2734	12438	As suicide remarks are torn 	From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
0	2735	12439	Plays wasted words, proves to warn	That he not busy being born is abusy dying.
0	2736	12440	Temptation's page aflies out the door,	You follow, find yourself at war,
0	2737	12441	Watch waterfalls of pity roar,	Feel to moan, but unlike before
0	2738	12442	You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.	So, don't fear if you hear
0	2739	12443	That foreign sound in your ear,	It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
0	2740	12444	Some warn victory, some downfall,	Private reasons  great or small 
0	2741	12445	Can be seen in the eyes of those that call	To make all that should be killed to crawl
0	2742	12446	"While others say, ""Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."""	Disillusioned words like abullets bark
0	2743	12447	As human gods aim for their mark,	Make everything from toy guns that spark
0	2744	12448	To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark 	Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
0	2745	12449	While preachers preach of evil fates,	Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
0	2746	12450	Can lead to hundreddollar plates,	Goodness hides behind its gates,
0	2747	12451	But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.	And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
0	2748	12452	It's people's games you got to dodge,	But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
0	2749	12453	Advertising signs that con	You into thinking you're the one
1	2750	12454	That can do what's anever been done,	That can win what's anever been won 
0	2751	12455	Meantime life outside goes on all around you.	You lose yourself, you reappear,
0	2752	12456	You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,	Alone you stand with nobody near
0	2753	12457	When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,	Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
0	2754	12458	A question in your nerves is lit,	Yet you know there is ano answer fit
0	2755	12459	To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,	Keep it in your mind and not forget
0	2756	12460	That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.	And, though the masters make the rules
0	2757	12461	For the wise men and the fools,	I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
0	2758	12462	Oldlady judges watch people in pairs,	Limited in sex they dare
0	2759	12463	To push fake morals, insult, and stare,	Money doesn't talk, it swears,
0	2760	12464	Obscenity  who really cares?  propaganda all is phony.	While them that defend what they cannot see
0	2761	12465	With a killer's pride, security,	It blows their minds most bitterly,
0	2762	12466	For them that think death's honesty	Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
0	2763	12467	My eyes collide headon with stuffed	Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
0	2764	12468	At pettiness, which plays so rough,	Walk upsidedown inside handcuffs,
0	2765	12469	Kick my legs to crash it off,	"Say, ""Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"""
0	2766	12470	And, if my thoughtdreams could be seen,	They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
0	2767	12471	"""There must be some way outta here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no release."
0	2768	12472	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
0	2769	12473	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
0	2770	12474	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."""
0	2771	12475	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
0	2772	12476	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
0	2773	12477	"God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son."""	"Abe said, ""Man, you must be putting me on."""
0	2774	12478	"God said, ""No."" Abe said, ""What?"""	"God said, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but"
0	2775	12479	"The next time you see me coming you better run."""	"Abe said, ""Where you want this killing done?"""
0	2776	12480	"God said, ""Out on Highway 61."""	Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
0	2777	12481	Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.	"He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?"""
0	2778	12482	"And Howard said, ""There's only one place I know."""	"And Sam said, ""Well, tell me quick, man  I got to run!"""
0	2779	12483	And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:	"""That way down Highway 61."""
0	2780	12484	Well, theMack the Finger said to Louis the King,	"""I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings"
0	2781	12485	And a thousand telephones that don't ring 	"Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"""
0	2782	12486	"And Louis the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son."""	"And then, ""Yeah, I think it can be easily done:"
0	2783	12487	"Take it on down to Highway 61."""	Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
0	2784	12488	Told her first own father that things weren't right:	"""My complexion,"" she said, ""  much too white."""
0	2785	12489	"""Come on over here, girl, and step into this light  ahh, you're right,"	"Let me tell the second mother this has been done."""
0	2786	12490	But the second mother was with the seventh son	And they were both out on Highway 61.
0	2787	12491	The roving gambler was avery bored,	Tried to create a next world war.
0	2788	12492	Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:	"""No, I never did engage in this akinda thing before,"
0	2789	12493	But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.	We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
0	2790	12494	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	2791	12495	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall""  you thought they were all kidding you."
0	2792	12496	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out;
1	2793	12497	Now you don't talk so loud,	Now you don't seem so proud
0	2794	12498	About having to be scrounging for your next meal 	How does it feel,
1	2795	12499	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	2796	12500	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	2797	12501	Like a rolling stone?	You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
0	2798	12502	But you know you only used to get juiced in it,	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
0	2799	12503	And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.	You said you'd never compromise
0	2800	12504	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize	He's not selling any alibis
0	2801	12505	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes	"And say, ""Would you like to make a deal?"""
1	2802	12506	How does it feel,	How does it feel,
1	2803	12507	To be without a home,	With no direction home,
1	2804	12508	Like a complete unknown,	Just like a rolling stone?
0	2805	12509	You never turned around to see the frowns	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
0	2806	12510	You never understood that it ain't no good,	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
0	2807	12511	You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat 
0	2808	12512	Ain't it hard when you discover that	He really wasn't where it's at
0	2809	12513	After he's taken everything he could steal?	How does it feel,
1	2810	12514	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	2811	12515	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	2812	12516	Just like a rolling stone?	Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
0	2813	12517	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,	Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
0	2814	12518	But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.	You used to be so amused
0	2815	12519	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 	Ago to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
0	2816	12520	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose 	You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
1	2817	12521	How does it feel,	How does it feel,
1	2818	12522	To be without a home,	With no direction home,
1	2819	12523	Like a complete unknown,	Just like a rolling stone?
0	2820	12524	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
0	2821	12525	How many seas must the white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
0	2822	12526	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
1	2823	12527	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	2824	12528	How many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
0	2825	12529	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
0	2826	12530	Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
1	2827	12531	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	And the answer is blowing in the wind.
0	2828	12532	How many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
0	2829	12533	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
0	2830	12534	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
1	2831	12535	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
1	2832	12536	Thank you!	Goodnight!
0	2833	12537	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
0	2834	12538	Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
0	2835	12539	And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,	Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
0	2836	12540	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
0	2837	12541	I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.	We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
0	2838	12542	Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	She turned around to look at me as I was awalking away,
0	2839	12543	"I heard her say over my shoulder, ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
0	2840	12544	I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
0	2841	12545	So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,	Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
0	2842	12546	But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,	I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
0	2843	12547	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
0	2844	12548	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
0	2845	12549	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""Don't I know your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
0	2846	12550	I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
0	2847	12551	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
0	2848	12552	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
0	2849	12553	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
0	2850	12554	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
0	2851	12555	There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,	Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
0	2852	12556	She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,	And, when it finallythe bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
0	2853	12557	The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
0	2854	12558	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
0	2855	12559	Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
0	2856	12560	But me, I'm still on the road, aheading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
0	2857	12561	They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,	She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
0	2858	12562	'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight	And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
0	2859	12563	They walked along by the old canal, a little confused  I remember well 	And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
0	2860	12564	He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,	Moving with a simple twist of fate.
0	2861	12565	A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,	As the light burst through a beatup shade, where he was waking up,
0	2862	12566	She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate	And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
0	2863	12567	He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,	He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
0	2864	12568	Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,	Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
0	2865	12569	He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,	Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
0	2866	12570	Maybe she'll pick him out again  how long must he wait	One more time for a simple twist of fate?
0	2867	12571	People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,	I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
0	2868	12572	She was born in spring, but I was born too late 	Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
0	2869	12573	Our conversation was short and sweet,	It nearly swept me off of my feet 
1	2870	12574	And I'm back in the rain,	Oh, and you are on dry land,
1	2871	12575	You made it there somehow,	You're a big girl now.
0	2872	12576	Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,	He's singing his song for me at his own expense 
0	2873	12577	And I'm just like that bird,	Oh, singing just for you,
0	2874	12578	I hope that you can hear	Hear me singing through these tears.
0	2875	12579	Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,	Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
1	2876	12580	I can change, I swear,	Oh, see what you can do,
1	2877	12581	I can make it through,	You can make it too.
0	2878	12582	Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,	You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days 
0	2879	12583	Oh, I know where I can find you,	Oh, in somebody's room,
1	2880	12584	It's a price I have to pay,	You're a big girl all the way.
0	2881	12585	A change in the weather is known to be extreme,	But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
0	2882	12586	I'm going out of my mind,	Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
0	2883	12587	Like a corkscrew to my heart	Ever since we've been apart.
0	2884	12588	Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,	Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
0	2885	12589	They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,	She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me 
0	2886	12590	I can't help it if I'm lucky.	People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
0	2887	12591	Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.	Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
0	2888	12592	I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,	Sweet lady.
0	2889	12593	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,	Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
0	2890	12594	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
0	2891	12595	I ran into the fortuneteller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,	I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
0	2892	12596	There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,	You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
0	2893	12597	After losing every battle.	I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
0	2894	12598	Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.	You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
0	2895	12599	One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,	Blood on your saddle.
0	2896	12600	Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,	Blowing through the curtains in your room,
0	2897	12601	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
0	2898	12602	It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,	You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just awasn't enough to change my heart.
0	2899	12603	Now everything's a little upside down  as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,	What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
0	2900	12604	You're on the bottom.	I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
0	2901	12605	I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.	The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stonefaced while the building burned,
0	2902	12606	I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned	Slowly into autumn.
0	2903	12607	Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,	From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
0	2904	12608	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
0	2905	12609	I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,	Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
0	2906	12610	Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,	I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
0	2907	12611	And all your raging glory.	I been doublecrossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
0	2908	12612	I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.	You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
0	2909	12613	And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love	And it makes me feel so sorry.
0	2910	12614	Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,	Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
0	2911	12615	Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,	We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
0	2912	12616	I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,	Never been so easy or so slow.
0	2913	12617	I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
0	2914	12618	Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,	It always has hit me from below,
0	2915	12619	But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
0	2916	12620	Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,	You could make me cry if you don't know.
0	2917	12621	Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
0	2918	12622	Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,	Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
0	2919	12623	Blue river running slow and lazy,	I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
0	2920	12624	Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad 	Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
0	2921	12625	But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
0	2922	12626	You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,	Staying far behind without you,
0	2923	12627	You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,	You're gonna make me give myself a good talkingto.
0	2924	12628	I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,	You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
0	2925	12629	But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
1	2926	12630	Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,	Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
0	2927	12631	Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.	They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
0	2928	12632	They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,	But ayou wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
1	2929	12633	Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,	Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
0	2930	12634	Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.	Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
0	2931	12635	Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,	Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
1	2932	12636	Look at the sun sinking like a ship,	Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
0	2933	12637	The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,	The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
0	2934	12638	The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,	Anyone with any sense had already left town;
0	2935	12639	He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.	"He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set it up for everyone,"" he said,"
0	2936	12640	Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,	And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
0	2937	12641	"""Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"""	Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
0	2938	12642	Backstage the girls were playing fivecard stud by the stairs,	Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
0	2939	12643	Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,	A gentle breeze was blowing  you could feel it from inside,
0	2940	12644	Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.	Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
0	2941	12645	He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.	With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
0	2942	12646	He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,	But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
0	2943	12647	Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,	She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
0	2944	12648	She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,	"""Sorry, darling, that I'm late,"" but he didn't seem to hear:"
0	2945	12649	He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.	I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
0	2946	12650	Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.	But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights adid dim
0	2947	12651	And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,	Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
0	2948	12652	Lily was a princess, she was fairskinned and precious as a child,	She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
0	2949	12653	She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs	With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
0	2950	12654	But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.	The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
0	2951	12655	The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.	It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
0	2952	12656	And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king 	No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
0	2953	12657	Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,	She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
0	2954	12658	She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,	Was looking to do just one good deed before she died 
0	2955	12659	She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.	Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
0	2956	12660	"""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you musta known it would someday."	Be careful not to touch the wall  there's a brandnew coat of paint,
0	2957	12661	"I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."""	Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
0	2958	12662	The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,	"""There's something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air."""
0	2959	12663	He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge awas drunk,	As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk 
0	2960	12664	There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.	No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
0	2961	12665	The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked	And Big Jim was standing there  you couldn't say  surprised,
0	2962	12666	Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes 	She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
0	2963	12667	Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall	And cleaned out the bank safe  it's said they got off with quite a haul.
0	2964	12668	In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground	For one more member, who had business back in town,
0	2965	12669	For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.	The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
0	2966	12670	Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,	And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
0	2967	12671	The hanging judge awas sober, he hadn't had a drink,	The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
0	2968	12672	"The cabaret was empty now, a sign said ""Closed for Repair"","	Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
0	2969	12673	She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,	Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
0	2970	12674	If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,	She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
0	2971	12675	Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,	She might think that I've forgotten her  don't tell her, it isn't so.
0	2972	12676	We had a fallingout like lovers often will	And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
0	2973	12677	And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,	She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
0	2974	12678	If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,	I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
0	2975	12679	Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way	For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
0	2976	12680	I see a lot of people as I make the rounds	And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
0	2977	12681	And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,	Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
0	2978	12682	Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,	I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
0	2979	12683	If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,	Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
0	2980	12684	'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,	When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
0	2981	12685	I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2982	12686	And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,	I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
0	2983	12687	In a world of steeleyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2984	12688	Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,	Everything up to that point had been left unresolved 
0	2985	12689	Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2986	12690	I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,	Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
0	2987	12691	Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2988	12692	Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there	With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
0	2989	12693	She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2990	12694	Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,	I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed 
0	2991	12695	Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2992	12696	Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,	But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
0	2993	12697	And the oneeyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2994	12698	I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove	And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love 
0	2995	12699	Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2996	12700	In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,	I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
0	2997	12701	I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	2998	12702	Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,	Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
0	2999	12703	If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3000	12704	Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,	Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
0	3001	12705	Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,	You got all the love, ahoney baby, I can stand.
0	3002	12706	I been meek and hard like an oak,	I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
0	3003	12707	Friends will arrive, friends will disappear 	If you want me, ahoney baby, I'll be here.
1	3004	12708	I like the smile in your fingertips,	I like the way that you move your hips,
0	3005	12709	I like the cool way you look at me,	Everything about you is bringing me misery.
0	3006	12710	Little red wagon, little red bike,	I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
0	3007	12711	I like the way you love me strong and slow,	I'm taking you with me, ahoney baby, where I go.
0	3008	12712	Life is sad, life is a bust,	All you can do is do what you must,
0	3009	12713	You do what you must do and you do it well 	I do it for you, ahoney baby, can't you tell?
0	3010	12714	I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face 	You break your promise all over the place.
0	3011	12715	You promised to love me, but what do I see?	Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
0	3012	12716	Odds and ends, odds and ends,	Lost time is not found again.
0	3013	12717	Now, you take your file and you bend my head,	I never can remember anything that you've said.
0	3014	12718	You promised to love me, but what do I know?	You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
0	3015	12719	Odds and ends, odds and ends,	Lost time is not found again.
0	3016	12720	Now, I've had enough, my box is clean 	You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
0	3017	12721	From now on you'd best get on someone else 	While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
0	3018	12722	Odds and ends, odds and ends,	Lost time is not found again.
0	3019	12723	Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,	Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
0	3020	12724	And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,	They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
1	3021	12725	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	3022	12726	It's that million dollar bash.	Everybody from right now to over there and back,
0	3023	12727	The louder they come, the bigger they crack.	Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
0	3024	12728	We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	3025	12729	Ooh, baby, oohee,	It's that million dollar bash.
0	3026	12730	Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,	Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
0	3027	12731	And along came Jones, emptied the trash,	Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
1	3028	12732	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	3029	12733	It's that million dollar bash.	Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
0	3030	12734	I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,	First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
0	3031	12735	But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	3032	12736	Ooh, baby, oohee,	It's that million dollar bash.
0	3033	12737	Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,	I punched myself in the face with my fist,
0	3034	12738	I took my potatoes down to be mashed,	And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
1	3035	12739	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	3036	12740	I'm going down to Rose Marie's,	She never does me wrong,
1	3037	12741	She puts it to me plain as day	And gives it to me for a song.
0	3038	12742	It's a wicked life, but what the hell?	Oh, everybody's got to eat
0	3039	12743	And I'm just the same as anyone else	When it comes to scratching for my meat.
0	3040	12744	Going to Acapulco, going on the run,	Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
0	3041	12745	Yeah! going to have some fun.	Now, whenever I get up and
0	3042	12746	Can't find what I need,	I just make it down to Rose Marie's
0	3043	12747	And get something quick to eat.	It's not a bad way to make a living
0	3044	12748	And I ain't complaining none	For I can blow my plum and break my rum
0	3045	12749	And then go on home and have my fun.	Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
0	3046	12750	Going to Acto see soft gut, going to have some fun,	Yeah! going to have some fun.
0	3047	12751	Now, if someone offers me a joke,	I just say no thanks,
0	3048	12752	I try to tell it like it is	And keep away from pranks.
0	3049	12753	Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,	I just go pump on it some.
0	3050	12754	Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places	And just set there waiting for me to come.
0	3051	12755	Going to Acapulco, going on the run,	Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
0	3052	12756	I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,	My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
0	3053	12757	The coachman, he hit me for my hook andand he asked me my name,	I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
1	3054	12758	Lo and behold! Lo and behold!	Looking for my lo and behold!
0	3055	12759	Get me outta here, my dear man!	I come into Pittsburgh at sixthirty flat,
0	3056	12760	I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.	"""What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"""
0	3057	12761	"""What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chickentown!"""	Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
0	3058	12762	Looking for my lo and behold!	Get me outta here, my dear man!
0	3059	12763	I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,	Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
0	3060	12764	I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,	Wanna save my money and rip it up.
1	3061	12765	Lo and behold! Lo and behold!	Looking for my lo and behold!
0	3062	12766	Get me outta here, my dear man!	Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
0	3063	12767	I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.	Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
0	3064	12768	Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.	Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
0	3065	12769	Looking for my lo and behold!	Get me outta here, my dear man!
0	3066	12770	After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,	Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
0	3067	12771	Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,	"Someone else asked, ""What do you care?"" Papa said, ""Well, just because."""
0	3068	12772	Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,	It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
0	3069	12773	The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,	The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
0	3070	12774	"""Have you heard the news?"" he said with a grin, ""The Vice President's gone mad!"""	"""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night."" ""Hmm, gee, that's too bad."""
0	3071	12775	"""Well, there's nothing we can do about it,"" said the neighbor, ""Just something we're gonna have to forget."""	"""Yes, I guess so,"" said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet."
0	3072	12776	"I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?"""	"I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em."" He said, ""You always help out around here with the chores?"""
0	3073	12777	"I said, ""Sometime, not all the time."" Then my neighbor, he blew his nose"	"Just as papa yelled outside, ""Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"""
0	3074	12778	Woohoo!	Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,

0	3086	12790	Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,	Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
0	3087	12791	Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,	Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
0	3088	12792	I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,	Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
1	3089	12793	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
0	3090	12794	I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.	Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
0	3091	12795	Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?	I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
0	3092	12796	I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
0	3093	12797	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!	I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
0	3094	12798	Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,	I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
0	3095	12799	I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,	I'm Tboned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
1	3096	12800	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
0	3097	12801	I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.	Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
0	3098	12802	If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.	Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
0	3099	12803	Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?	Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!

0	3101	12805	We carried you in our arms on Independence Day	And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
0	3102	12806	Oh, what dear daughter would'neath the sunwould treat her father so?	"To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer ""no""?"
0	3103	12807	Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?	Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
0	3104	12808	It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,	Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
0	3105	12809	Now, I want you to know that, while you watcheddiscover that there was no one true,	That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
0	3106	12810	Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?	Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
0	3107	12811	It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive	All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
0	3108	12812	And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,	But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
0	3109	12813	Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?	Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
0	3110	12814	Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:	One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
0	3111	12815	Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,	Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
0	3112	12816	Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,	Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
0	3113	12817	Well, there's too much of nothingcan cause a man to weep,	He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
0	3114	12818	But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book	And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
0	3115	12819	Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,	Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
0	3116	12820	Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,	It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
0	3117	12821	Everybody's doing something  I've heard it in a dream,	But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
0	3118	12822	Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,	Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
0	3119	12823	Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,	The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
0	3120	12824	On the very next day with a nose full of pus,	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
1	3121	12825	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
0	3122	12826	It's a onetrack town, just brown and a breeze, too,	Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
0	3123	12827	For Wichita in a pile of fruit,	Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
1	3124	12828	Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!	Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
0	3125	12829	Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,	Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
0	3126	12830	Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,	Take me down to California, baby!

0	3128	12832	Take me down to California, baby!	Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
0	3129	12833	Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed	On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
1	3130	12834	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
1	3131	12835	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!	Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
0	3132	12836	Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,	Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
0	3133	12837	Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,	You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,

0	3137	12841	Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?	Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
0	3138	12842	Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,	Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
0	3139	12843	Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,	It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
0	3140	12844	Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?	Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
0	3141	12845	Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.	Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
0	3142	12846	'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.	Tell 'emeverybody down in old Frisco
0	3143	12847	That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.	Skinny Moo and TBone Frank,

0	3148	12852	Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,	Join the monk, C.I.O.,
0	3149	12853	Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.	Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
0	3150	12854	Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,	Trick on in, flower that smoll,
0	3151	12855	Take it on down to give me grow.	Now, play that low and pick it up,
0	3152	12856	Take it on in in a bowlcup.	Threelegged man and a hotlipped hoe,
0	3153	12857	Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.	Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
0	3154	12858	Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze 	Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.

0	3156	12860	I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,	Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
0	3157	12861	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!	Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
0	3158	12862	Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,	Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
0	3159	12863	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!	Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
0	3160	12864	Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,	"""But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"""
0	3161	12865	Oohee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!	Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
0	3162	12866	Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,	I's looking around just to see who was born.
0	3163	12867	I spied a little chicken adown on his knees,	"I went up and yelled to him, ""Please, please, please!"""
1	3164	12868	"She said, ""Don't you tell Henry,"	Don't you tell Henry,
0	3165	12869	"Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."""	Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
0	3166	12870	I's looking around just to see myself.	I looked high and low and I looked up above,
0	3167	12871	But who did I see but the one I love?	"She said, ""Now, don't you tell Henry,"
0	3168	12872	Don't you tell Henry,	"Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."""
0	3169	12873	Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,	I was looking around, I was outta sight.
1	3170	12874	I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,	I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
1	3171	12875	"They said, ""Don't you tell Henry,"	Don't you tell Henry
0	3172	12876	"Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."""	Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
0	3173	12877	I's looking around just to see who was born.	I saw a little chicken adown on his knees,
0	3174	12878	"I went up and yelled to him, ""Please, please, please!"""	"She said, ""Don't you tell Henry,"
0	3175	12879	Don't you tell Henry,	"Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."""
0	3176	12880	Nothing was delivered	And I tell this truth to you
0	3177	12881	Not out of spite, nor anger,	But simply because it's true.
0	3178	12882	Now, I hope you won't object to giving	Giving back all of what you owe,
0	3179	12883	The fewer words you have to waste on this,	The sooner you can go.
0	3180	12884	Nothing is better, nothing is best,	Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
0	3181	12885	Nothing was delivered,	But I can't say I sympathize
0	3182	12886	With what your fate is going to be,	Yes, for telling all those lies.
0	3183	12887	Now, you must provide some answers	For what you sold that's not been received
1	3184	12888	And the sooner you come up with them,	The sooner you can leave.
0	3185	12889	Nothing is better, nothing is best,	Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
0	3186	12890	Now, you know, nothing was delivered	And it's up to you to say
0	3187	12891	Just what you had in mind	When you made everybody pay.
0	3188	12892	No, nothing was delivered,	Yes, and someone must explain
0	3189	12893	That, as long as it takes to do this,	Then that's howas long as you'll remain.
0	3190	12894	Nothing is better, nothing is best,	Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
0	3191	12895	Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim	That he'd always make sure I'd understand
0	3192	12896	And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim	If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
1	3193	12897	Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,	Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
0	3194	12898	But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.	Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
0	3195	12899	That fellow who never blushes,	And that is that one must always flush out his house
0	3196	12900	If he don't expect to be housing flushes.	Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
0	3197	12901	Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,	But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
0	3198	12902	"""Take care of all of your memories,"" said Mick,"	"""For you cannot relive them"
0	3199	12903	And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick	"That you must always first forgive them."""
1	3200	12904	Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,	Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
1	3201	12905	Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,	Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
0	3202	12906	I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.	There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
0	3203	12907	There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,	Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
1	3204	12908	Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,	Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
0	3205	12909	If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,	So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
0	3206	12910	No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell	And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
0	3207	12911	This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,	Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
0	3208	12912	If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace	And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
0	3209	12913	If I knew for sure that it was yours  but it was, oh, so hard to tell! 	And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
0	3210	12914	This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,	Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
0	3211	12915	If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one	That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
0	3212	12916	And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,	You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
0	3213	12917	This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,	Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
0	3214	12918	Pistolshots ring out in the barroom night,	Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
0	3215	12919	She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,	"Cries out, ""My God, they've killed 'em all!"""
0	3216	12920	"Here comes the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
0	3217	12921	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
0	3218	12922	Three bodies lying there does Patty see	And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
0	3219	12923	"""I didn't do it!"" he says and he throws up his hands,"	"""I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!"
0	3220	12924	"I saw them leaving,"" he says and he stops,"	"""One of us had better call up the cops."""
0	3221	12925	And so Patty calls the cops	And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
0	3222	12926	Meanwhile far away in another part of town,	Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
0	3223	12927	The number one contender for the middleweight crown	Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
0	3224	12928	When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road 	Just like the time before and the time before that.
0	3225	12929	In Paterson, that's just the way things go:	If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
0	3226	12930	Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,	Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
0	3227	12931	"He said, ""I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,"	"Jumped into a white car with outofstate plates."""
0	3228	12932	And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,	"Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"""
0	3229	12933	So they took him to the infirmary	And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
0	3230	12934	Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,	They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
0	3231	12935	The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,	"Said, ""Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"""
0	3232	12936	"Here's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	The man the authorities came to blame
0	3233	12937	For something that he never done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
0	3234	12938	Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,	Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
0	3235	12939	While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game	And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
0	3236	12940	"""Remember that murder that youhappened in a bar?"	Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
0	3237	12941	Think you'd like to play ball with the law?	"Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."""
0	3238	12942	"Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure."""	"The cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break "
0	3239	12943	We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,	If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
0	3240	12944	You'll be doing society a favor,	That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver.
0	3241	12945	We wanna put his ass in the stir,	"We wanna pin this triple murder on him  he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."""
0	3242	12946	Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,	But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
0	3243	12947	"""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""and I do it for pay"	"And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"""
0	3244	12948	Up into some paradise	Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
0	3245	12949	And ride a horse along the trail,	But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
0	3246	12950	All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,	The trial was a pigcircus, he never had a chance:
0	3247	12951	The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,	To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
0	3248	12952	And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,	No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
0	3249	12953	And, though they could not produce the gun,	The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the allwhite jury agreed.
0	3250	12954	Rubin Carter was falsely tried,	The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
0	3251	12955	Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,	The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
0	3252	12956	How can the life of such a man	Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
0	3253	12957	To see him obviously framed	Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
0	3254	12958	Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties	Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
0	3255	12959	While Rubin sits like Buddha in a tenfoot cell,	An innocent man in a living hell.
0	3256	12960	"Yes, that's the story of the ""Hurricane"","	But it won't be over till they clear his name
0	3257	12961	And give him back the time he's done,	Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
0	3258	12962	I married Isis on the fifth day of May,	But I could not hold on to her very long,
0	3259	12963	So I cut off amy hair and I rode straight away	For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
0	3260	12964	I came to a high place of darkness and light,	Dividing line ran through the center of town,
0	3261	12965	I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,	Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
0	3262	12966	A man in the corner approached me for a match,	I knew right away he was not ordinary,
0	3263	12967	"He said, ""Are you looking for something easy to catch?"""	"Said, ""I got no money."" He said, ""That ain't necessary."""
0	3264	12968	We set out that night for the cold in the north,	I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
0	3265	12969	"I said, ""Where are we going?"" He said we'd be back by the fourth."	"I said, ""That's the best news that I've ever heard."""
0	3266	12970	I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,	I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
0	3267	12971	As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,	I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
0	3268	12972	How she told me that one day we would meet up again	And things would be different the next time we wed
0	3269	12973	If I only could ahang on and just be her friend 	I still can't remember all the best things she said.
0	3270	12974	We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,	"He said, ""There's a body I'm trying to find."
0	3271	12975	"If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."""	'Twas athen that I knew what he had on his mind.
0	3272	12976	The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,	We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
0	3273	12977	When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,	But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
0	3274	12978	I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.	There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
0	3275	12979	When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,	When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
0	3276	12980	I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,	Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
0	3277	12981	I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,	Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
0	3278	12982	She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,	Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
0	3279	12983	I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,	I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
0	3280	12984	"She said, ""Where you been?"" I said, ""No place special."""	"She said, ""You look adifferent."" I said, ""Well, I guess."""
0	3281	12985	"She said, ""You been gone."" I said, ""That's only natural."""	"She said, ""You gonna stay?"" I said, ""If you want me to, yes!"""
0	3282	12986	Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,	What drives ame to you is what drives me insane,
0	3283	12987	I still can remember the way that you smiled	On the fifth day of May in the drizzling arain.
0	3284	12988	I like to spend some time in Mozambique,	The sunny sky is aquablue,
0	3285	12989	And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,	It's very nice to stay a week or two
0	3286	12990	And maybe fall in love, just me and you.	There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
0	3287	12991	And plenty time for good romance	And everybody likes to stop and speak,
0	3288	12992	To give the special one you seek a chance	And maybe say hello with just a glance.
0	3289	12993	Lying next to her by the ocean,	Reaching out and touching her hand,
0	3290	12994	Whispering your secret emotion 	Magic in a magical land.
0	3291	12995	And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,	To say goodbye to sand and sea,
0	3292	12996	You turn around to take a final peek	And you see why it's so unique to be
0	3293	12997	Among the lovely people living free	Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
0	3294	12998	Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,	Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
0	3295	12999	But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,	Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
0	3296	13000	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
0	3297	13001	Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,	He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
0	3298	13002	He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,	His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
0	3299	13003	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
0	3300	13004	Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,	You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
0	3301	13005	And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,	But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
0	3302	13006	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
0	3303	13007	Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,	You should not treat me like a stranger,
0	3304	13008	Our Father would not like the way that you act	And you must realize the danger.
0	3305	13009	Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?	And one deserving of affection?
0	3306	13010	And is our purpose not the same on this earth,	To love and follow His direction?
0	3307	13011	We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,	We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
0	3308	13012	Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,	Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
0	3309	13013	Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:	You may not see me tomorrow.
0	3310	13014	Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of awho knows when,	Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
0	3311	13015	Always on the outside of whatever side there was,	"When they asked him why it had to be that way, ""Well,"" he answered, ""just because."""
0	3312	13016	Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,	"They called Joe ""Crazy"", the baby they called ""Kid Blast"","
0	3313	13017	Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,	It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
0	3314	13018	Joey, Joey,	King of the streets, child of clay,
0	3315	13019	Joey, Joey,	What made them want to come and blow you away?
0	3316	13020	There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,	No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
0	3317	13021	When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost ahit the roof,	He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
0	3318	13022	When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,	Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
0	3319	13023	Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,	"They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em ""amateurs""."
0	3320	13024	The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,	"""Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."""
0	3321	13025	"But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, ""We're not those kind of men,"	"It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."""
0	3322	13026	Joey, Joey,	King of the streets, child of clay,
0	3323	13027	Joey, Joey,	What made them want to come and blow you away?
0	3324	13028	"The police department hounded him, they called him ""Mr. Smith"","	They got him on conspiracy  they were never sure who with.
0	3325	13029	"""What time is it?"" said the judge to Joey when they met."	"""Five to ten,"" said Joey. Judge says, ""That's exactly what you get."""
0	3326	13030	He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,	They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
0	3327	13031	His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand	What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
0	3328	13032	They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,	But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
0	3329	13033	He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,	"To the boss said, ""I have returned and now I want what's mine."""
0	3330	13034	Joey, Joey,	King of the streets, child of clay,
0	3331	13035	Joey, Joey,	What made them want to come and blow you away?
0	3332	13036	It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:	"""I'm around too many children,"" he'd say, ""they should never know of one."""
0	3333	13037	Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,	"Emptied out the register, said, ""Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."""
0	3334	13038	One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,	He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
0	3335	13039	He pushed the table over to protect his family,	Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
0	3336	13040	Joey, Joey,	King of the streets, child of clay,
0	3337	13041	Joey, Joey,	What made them want to come and blow you away?
0	3338	13042	Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,	"I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, ""He ain't dead, he's just asleep"","
0	3339	13043	And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave 	I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
0	3340	13044	The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of aBrooklyn mourned,	They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
0	3341	13045	Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,	I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
0	3342	13046	Joey, Joey,	King of the streets, child of clay,
0	3343	13047	Joey, Joey,	What made them want to come and blow you away?
0	3344	13048	Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,	Dust on my face and my cape,
0	3345	13049	Me and Magdalena on the run,	I think this time we should escape.
0	3346	13050	Sold my guitar to the baker's son	For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
0	3347	13051	But I can get another one	And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
0	3348	13052	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	3349	13053	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	3350	13054	Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,	Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
0	3351	13055	At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,	Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
0	3352	13056	Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?	Was it my hand that held the gun?
0	3353	13057	Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,	The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
0	3354	13058	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	3355	13059	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	3356	13060	At the corrida we'll sit in the shade	And watch the young torero stand alone,
0	3357	13061	We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed	When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
0	3358	13062	Then the padre will recite the prayers of old	In the little church athis side of town,
0	3359	13063	I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,	You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
0	3360	13064	The way, it is long, but the end is near,	Already the fiesta has begun,
0	3361	13065	The face of God will appear	With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
0	3362	13066	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	3363	13067	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	3364	13068	Was that the thunder that I heard?	My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
0	3365	13069	Come sit by me, don't say a word.	Oh, can it be that I am slain?
0	3366	13070	Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,	Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
0	3367	13071	Aim well, my little one,	We may not make it through the night.
0	3368	13072	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	3369	13073	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	3370	13074	Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,	Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks anothing like that,
0	3371	13075	And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.	She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
0	3372	13076	She smiles, walks the other way	As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
0	3373	13077	As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.	"""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, ""am I hearing you right?"""
0	3374	13078	And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,	She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
0	3375	13079	She starts to speak, but he walks away	As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
0	3376	13080	A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business awith a tiny man, who sells him a ring,	"Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, ""Can you see anything?"""
0	3377	13081	Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck	"While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, ""Open up another deck"","
0	3378	13082	"But the dealer says, ""Attendezvous, s'il vous plait"","	As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
0	3379	13083	The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,	"He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand!"" She said, ""That ain't enough."""
0	3380	13084	Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horsedrawn taxi waited at the curb,	"She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a""Do Not Disturb""."
0	3381	13085	She knocked upon it anyway	As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
0	3382	13086	"""I've got to talk to someone quick!"" But the Greek said, ""Go away!"", and he kicked the chair to the floor."	"He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, ""Help, there's danger near, please aopen up athe door!"""
0	3383	13087	Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,	The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
0	3384	13088	"The desk clerk said, ""It happens every day"","	As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
0	3385	13089	As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.	"The dealer said, ""It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."""
0	3386	13090	The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,	"While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, ""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."""
0	3387	13091	She sheds a tear and then begins to pray	As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
0	3388	13092	I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,	It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
0	3389	13093	It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,	Seem like every time you turn around there's another hardluck story that you're gonna hear
0	3390	13094	And there's really nothing anyone can say 	And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
0	3391	13095	I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky	When the children were babies and played on the beach,
0	3392	13096	You came up behind me, I saw you go by,	You were always so close and still within reach.
0	3393	13097	Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?	Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
0	3394	13098	I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,	They run to the water their buckets to fill,
0	3395	13099	I can still see the shells falling out of their hands	As they follow each other back up the hill.
0	3396	13100	Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,	Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
0	3397	13101	Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,	Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
0	3398	13102	Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,	You in a marketplace in SavannalaMar.
0	3399	13103	Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,	Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
0	3400	13104	I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells 	I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
0	3401	13105	Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,	"Writing ""SadEyed Lady of the Lowlands"" for you."
0	3402	13106	Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,	Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
0	3403	13107	How did I meet you?I don't know,	A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
0	3404	13108	You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,	And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
0	3405	13109	Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,	Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
0	3406	13110	Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp	And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
0	3407	13111	You always responded when I needed your help,	You gave me a map and a key to your door.
0	3408	13112	Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,	Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
1	3409	13113	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	3410	13114	Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,	Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
0	3411	13115	It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!	No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	3412	13116	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
0	3413	13117	He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,	"Asks you with a grin, ""Are you having a good time?"""
0	3414	13118	Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!	Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
1	3415	13119	Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
0	3416	13120	He handsout in your face for kicks,	His bedroom window, it's amade outta bricks.
0	3417	13121	The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!	Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
1	3418	13122	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
0	3419	13123	She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,	Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
0	3420	13124	68, but says she's 24, ohh!	Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
1	3421	13125	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	3422	13126	I try my best to be like I am,	Everybody wants you to be like them,
0	3423	13127	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave  I get bored, whoaohh!"	Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	3424	13128	Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,	As the night comes in afalling, the dogs will lose their bark,
0	3425	13129	The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind	As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	3426	13130	From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade	And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
0	3427	13131	Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign	And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	3428	13132	It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good	When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
0	3429	13133	You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,	We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
0	3430	13134	I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay	Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
0	3431	13135	Well, the ragman draws circles	Up and down the block,
1	3432	13136	I'd ask him what the matter was,	But I know that he don't talk,
0	3433	13137	And the ladies treat me kindly	And furnish me with tape,
0	3434	13138	But, deep inside my heart,	Lord, I know I can't escape.
0	3435	13139	Oh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	3436	13140	Shakespeare, he's in the alley	With his pointed shoes and his bells,
0	3437	13141	Speaking to some French girl,	Who says she knows me well.
0	3438	13142	And I would send a message	To find out if she's talked,
0	3439	13143	But the post office has been stolen	And the mailbox is locked.
0	3440	13144	Oh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	3441	13145	Mona tried to tell me	Stay away from the train line,
0	3442	13146	She said that all the railroad men	Drink up your blood like wine.
0	3443	13147	"And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that,"	But, then again, there's only one I've met
0	3444	13148	And he just smoked my eyelids,	"And punched my cigarette."""
0	3445	13149	Ooh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
1	3446	13150	Grandpa died last week,	Now he's buried in the rocks,
0	3447	13151	Everyone still talks about	How badly they were shocked 
0	3448	13152	But me, I expected it to happen	When I seen him lose control,
0	3449	13153	He built a fire on Main Street	And shot it fulla holes.
0	3450	13154	Oh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	3451	13155	Well, my Ruthie said come see her	In her honkytonk lagoon,
0	3452	13156	Where I could watch her waltz for free	'Neath her Panamanian moon.
0	3453	13157	"I said, ""Oh, come on, now,"	"You must know about my debutante."""
0	3454	13158	"She said, ""Your debutante knows what you need,"	"But I know what you want."""
0	3455	13159	Oh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	3456	13160	Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,	Where the neon madmen climb,
0	3457	13161	They'd all fall there so perfectly,	It all seemed so welltimed,
0	3458	13162	And here I sit so patiently,	Waiting to find out what price
0	3459	13163	You have to pay to get outta	Going through all these things twice.
0	3460	13164	Oh, mama, can this really be the end 	To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
0	3461	13165	Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,	You should not treat me like a stranger,
0	3462	13166	Our Father would not like the way that you act	And you must realize the danger.
0	3463	13167	Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?	And one deserving of affection?
0	3464	13168	And is our purpose not the same on this earth,	To love and follow His direction?
0	3465	13169	We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,	We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
0	3466	13170	Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,	Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
0	3467	13171	Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:	You may not see me tomorrow.
0	3468	13172	We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,	We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
0	3469	13173	Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,	Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
0	3470	13174	Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:	You may not see me tomorrow.
1	3471	13175	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	3472	13176	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
0	3473	13177	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
0	3474	13178	Let's take a chance  who really cares?	Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
0	3475	13179	It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.	Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
0	3476	13180	Why wait any longer for no need to complain?	You can have love, but you might lose it.
0	3477	13181	Why run any longer when you're running in vain?	You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
0	3478	13182	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,	Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
1	3479	13183	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to hold you in the night 
0	3480	13184	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	3481	13185	'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,	Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
0	3482	13186	I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3483	13187	Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,	Everything up to that point had been left unresolved 
0	3484	13188	Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3485	13189	I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,	Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
0	3486	13190	Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3487	13191	Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there	With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
0	3488	13192	She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3489	13193	Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,	Nothing areally matters much, doom alone that counts,
0	3490	13194	And the oneeyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3491	13195	In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,	I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
0	3492	13196	I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3493	13197	Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,	I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed 
0	3494	13198	Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3495	13199	I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,	Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
0	3496	13200	If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3497	13201	Our conversation was short and sweet,	It nearly knocked me off of my feet 
1	3498	13202	And I'm back in the rain,	Eh, and you are on dry land,
1	3499	13203	You made it there somehow,	You're a big girl now.
0	3500	13204	Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,	He's singing his song for me at his own expense 
0	3501	13205	And I'm just like that bird,	Eh, singing just for you,
0	3502	13206	I ahope you can hear	Hear me singing through these tears.
0	3503	13207	Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,	You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days 
0	3504	13208	Oh, I know where I can find you,	Eh, in somebody's room,
1	3505	13209	It's a price I'll have to pay,	You're a big girl all the way.
0	3506	13210	Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,	Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
1	3507	13211	Well, I may just swear,	Eh, see what you can do,
1	3508	13212	I can make it through,	You can make it too.
0	3509	13213	A change in the weather is always extreme,	But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
0	3510	13214	I'm going out of my mind,	Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
0	3511	13215	Like a corkscrew to my heart	Ever since we've been apart.
0	3512	13216	I once held her in my arms,	She said she would always stay,
0	3513	13217	But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,	I threw it all away,
0	3514	13218	I threw it all away.	Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
0	3515	13219	And rivers that ran through every day,	But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
1	3516	13220	I threw it all away,	I threw it all away.
0	3517	13221	Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,	Love and only love  it can't be denied.
0	3518	13222	No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it 	Take a tip from aone who's tried.
0	3519	13223	So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,	Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
0	3520	13224	One thing for sure: there ain't no cure	If you throw it all away,
0	3521	13225	Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,	Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
0	3522	13226	They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,	She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me 
0	3523	13227	I can't help it if I'm lucky.	People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
0	3524	13228	Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.	And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
0	3525	13229	I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,	Sweet lady.
0	3526	13230	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,	Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
0	3527	13231	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
0	3528	13232	I ran into the fortuneteller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,	I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
0	3529	13233	There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,	He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
0	3530	13234	After losing every battle.	I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things areally are,
0	3531	13235	Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.	You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
0	3532	13236	One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,	Blood on your saddle.
0	3533	13237	Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,	Blowing through the curtains in your room,
0	3534	13238	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouthteeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
0	3535	13239	It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,	You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
0	3536	13240	Now everything's a little upside down  as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,	What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
0	3537	13241	You are on the bottom.	I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
0	3538	13242	I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.	The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stonefaced while the building burned,
0	3539	13243	I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned	Slowly into autumn.
0	3540	13244	Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,	From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
0	3541	13245	Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,	You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
0	3542	13246	I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,	Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
0	3543	13247	Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,	I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
0	3544	13248	And all your raging glory.	I've been doublecrossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
0	3545	13249	I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.	You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
0	3546	13250	And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love	And it makes me feel so sorry.
0	3547	13251	Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,	Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
0	3548	13252	Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,	We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
0	3549	13253	Sixteen years, sixteen banners united	Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
0	3550	13254	Desperate men, desperate women divided,	Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
0	3551	13255	Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows	To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
0	3552	13256	My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows	Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
0	3553	13257	The coldblooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,	Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
0	3554	13258	Whose ebony face is beyond communication,	The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
0	3555	13259	They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,	A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
0	3556	13260	I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow	Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
0	3557	13261	I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches	With the stitches still mending 'neath a heartshaped tattoo,
0	3558	13262	Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches	Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
0	3559	13263	The palace of mirrors, where dogsoldiers are reflected,	The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
0	3560	13264	The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,	Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
0	3561	13265	She wakes him up fortyeight hours later, the sun is breaking	Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
0	3562	13266	She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,	He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
0	3563	13267	"""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""I don't need your organization,"	I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
0	3564	13268	But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination	Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
0	3565	13269	"""Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor"	On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
0	3566	13270	Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders	"With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."""
1	3567	13271	I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,	I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
0	3568	13272	She broke her leg and needed shooting,	I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
1	3569	13273	Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,	Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
0	3570	13274	She got such a sweet disposition	I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
1	3571	13275	I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,	Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
0	3572	13276	She got great big hind legs,	Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
1	3573	13277	Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,	Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
0	3574	13278	Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to	Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
1	3575	13279	Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,	Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
0	3576	13280	You knowso nasty and you're so bad,	But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
0	3577	13281	In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,	"You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, ""He who cannot be trusted must fall."""
1	3578	13282	Loneliness, tenderness,	High society, notoriety.
0	3579	13283	You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink	And there's no time to think.
0	3580	13284	In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,	The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
1	3581	13285	Memory, ecstasy,	Tyranny, hypocrisy.
0	3582	13286	Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link	And there's no time to think.
0	3583	13287	Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,	I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
1	3584	13288	China doll, alcohol,	Duality, mortality.
0	3585	13289	Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink	And there's no time to think.
0	3586	13290	Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,	I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
1	3587	13291	Paradise, sacrifice,	Mortality, reality.
0	3588	13292	But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink	And there's no time to think.
0	3589	13293	Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,	Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
1	3590	13294	Equality, liberty,	Humility, simplicity.
0	3591	13295	You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink	And there's no time to think.
0	3592	13296	Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,	You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
1	3593	13297	Mercury, gravity,	Nobility, humility.
0	3594	13298	You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink	And there's no time to think.
0	3595	13299	You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,	Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
1	3596	13300	Socialism, hypnotism,	Patriotism, materialism.
0	3597	13301	Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink	And there's no time to think.
0	3598	13302	The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,	Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
1	3599	13303	Loyalty, unity,	Epitome, rigidity.
0	3600	13304	You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,	And there's no time to think.
0	3601	13305	Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,	Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
0	3602	13306	No time to choose when the truth must die,	No time to lose or say goodbye,
0	3603	13307	No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,	And no time to think.
0	3604	13308	You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,	But you're back where you belong.
0	3605	13309	Go get me my pistol, babe,	Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
1	3606	13310	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
0	3607	13311	Baby, please stop crying,	You know I know the sun will always shine,
0	3608	13312	But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.	Go down to the river, babe,
0	3609	13313	Honey, I will meet you there,	Go down to the river, babe,
0	3610	13314	Honey, I will pay your fare.	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
0	3611	13315	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,	Baby, please stop crying,
0	3612	13316	You know I know the sun will always shine,	But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
0	3613	13317	If you're looking for assistance, babe,	Or if you just want some company
0	3614	13318	Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,	Honey, come and see about me.
1	3615	13319	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
0	3616	13320	Baby, please stop crying,	You know I know the sun will always shine,
0	3617	13321	But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.	You been hurt so many times
0	3618	13322	And I know what you're thinking of,	Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
0	3619	13323	To see that you're madly in love.	But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
0	3620	13324	Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,	Baby, please stop crying,
0	3621	13325	You know I know the sun will always shine,	But, baby, please stop cryingit's tearing up my mind.
0	3622	13326	Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?	Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
0	3623	13327	I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.	Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
0	3624	13328	Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?	When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
0	3625	13329	Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?	Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
0	3626	13330	Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,	I've been in and out of ahappiness,
0	3627	13331	I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,	And I've anever been too impressed.
0	3628	13332	Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.	If I'm a fool, you can have the night  you can have the morning, too.
0	3629	13333	Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?	Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
0	3630	13334	Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?	Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
0	3631	13335	Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,	Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
0	3632	13336	Seem like I been down this way before,	Is there any truth in that, Senor?
0	3633	13337	Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?	How long are we gonna be riding?
0	3634	13338	How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?	Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
0	3635	13339	There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,	There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
0	3636	13340	There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot	"Where she held me in her arms one time and said, ""Forget me not."""
0	3637	13341	Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,	Smell the tail of the dragon,
0	3638	13342	Can't stand the suspense anymore	Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
0	3639	13343	Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled	Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
0	3640	13344	A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,	"She said, ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."""
0	3641	13345	Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,	Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
0	3642	13346	Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.	I'm ready when you are, Senor.
0	3643	13347	Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,	Disconnect these cables
0	3644	13348	This place don't make sense to me no more!	Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
0	3645	13349	I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,	When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
0	3646	13350	But I finally realize there's no room for regret:	True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
1	3647	13351	Hold me, baby, be near,	You told me that you'd be sincere,
0	3648	13352	But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.	True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
0	3649	13353	I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,	I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
0	3650	13354	I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,	All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
1	3651	13355	You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,	You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
0	3652	13356	And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.	True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
0	3653	13357	I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,	I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
0	3654	13358	Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,	All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
0	3655	13359	You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,	Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
0	3656	13360	Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.	True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
1	3657	13361	True love, true love, true love tends to forget,	True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
0	3658	13362	I think we better talk this over,	Maybe when we both get sober,
0	3659	13363	You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.	This situation can only get rougher,
0	3660	13364	Why should we needlessly suffer?	Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
0	3661	13365	You don't have to be afraid of looking ainto my face,	We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
0	3662	13366	I feel displaced, I got a lowdown feeling:	You been twofaced, you been doubledealing.
0	3663	13367	I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.	Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
0	3664	13368	I'm exiled, you can't convert me,	I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
0	3665	13369	You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,	Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
0	3666	13370	I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow	If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
0	3667	13371	It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.	But I don't think it's liable to happen 
0	3668	13372	Like the sound of aone hand clapping:	The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
0	3669	13373	Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,	Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
0	3670	13374	Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?	Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
0	3671	13375	Oh, baby, time for a new transition,	I wish I awas a magician,
0	3672	13376	There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,	Tears on the letter that I write,
0	3673	13377	There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,	But she's drifting like a satellite,
0	3674	13378	There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze	And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
0	3675	13379	There's a lonesome belltone in that valley of stone,	Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
0	3676	13380	Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,	But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
0	3677	13381	A fullblooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,	The time and the place that we'd part.
0	3678	13382	There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage	And a longtime, goldenhaired stripper onstage
0	3679	13383	And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write	Oh, where are you tonight?
0	3680	13384	The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,	To live it you had to explode.
0	3681	13385	In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:	Sacrifice was the code of the road.
0	3682	13386	I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,	Strong men belittled by doubt,
0	3683	13387	I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,	But she had some way of finding them out.
0	3684	13388	He took deadcenter aim, but he missed just the same,	She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
0	3685	13389	She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair	And discovered her invisible self.
0	3686	13390	There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,	There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
0	3687	13391	As her beauty fades and I watch her undrapewell, I won't, but then maybe again I might	Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
0	3688	13392	I fought with my twin, that enemy within,	Till both of us fell by the way,
0	3689	13393	Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees	While the law looks the other way.
0	3690	13394	Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,	The man you were loving could never get clean.
0	3691	13395	It felt out of place, my foot in his face,	But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
0	3692	13396	I bit into the root of forbidden fruit	With the juice running down my leg,
0	3693	13397	I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,	Who always was too proud to beg.
0	3694	13398	There's a whitediamond gloom on the dark side of this room	And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
0	3695	13399	If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,	Just remind me to show you the scars.
0	3696	13400	There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,	If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived
0	3697	13401	I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right	Oh, where are you tonight?
0	3698	13402	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	3699	13403	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	3700	13404	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
0	3701	13405	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
0	3702	13406	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
0	3703	13407	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	3704	13408	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	3705	13409	Take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	3706	13410	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
0	3707	13411	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
0	3708	13412	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
0	3709	13413	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
0	3710	13414	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
0	3711	13415	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	3712	13416	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	3713	13417	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	3714	13418	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	3715	13419	'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,	Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
0	3716	13420	I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3717	13421	If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,	I'll always ado my best for her, on that I give my word:
0	3718	13422	In a world of steeleyed death and men who are fighting to be born,	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3719	13423	I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,	Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
0	3720	13424	Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3721	13425	Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there	With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
0	3722	13426	She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3723	13427	Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove	And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love 
0	3724	13428	Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3725	13429	The deputy walks on ahard nails and the preacher rides a mount,	Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
0	3726	13430	And the oneeyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3727	13431	In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,	I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
0	3728	13432	I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
0	3729	13433	I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,	Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
0	3730	13434	If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:	"""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm."""
1	3731	13435	My love, she speaks like silence,	Without ideals or violence,
0	3732	13436	Doesn't have to say she's faithful,	Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
0	3733	13437	People carry roses,	Make promises by the hour;
0	3734	13438	My love, she laughs like the flowers,	Valentines can't buy her.
0	3735	13439	In the dimestores and busstations	People talk over situations,
0	3736	13440	Read books and repeat quotations,	Draw conclusions on the wall.
0	3737	13441	Some speak of the future;	My love, she speaks softly,
1	3738	13442	Knows there's no success like failure	And that failure's no success at all.
1	3739	13443	Cloak and dagger dangles,	Madams light the candles,
0	3740	13444	In ceremonies of the horsemen	Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
0	3741	13445	Statues made of matchsticks	Crumble into one another;
0	3742	13446	My love winks, she doesn't bother,	She knows too much to argue or to judge.
1	3743	13447	The bridge at midnight trembles,	The country doctor rambles,
0	3744	13448	Bankers' nieces seek perfection,	Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
1	3745	13449	The wind howls like a hammer,	The night blows cold and rainy,
0	3746	13450	My love, she's like some raven	At my window with a broken wing.
0	3747	13451	You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,	"You see someone naked and you say, ""Who is that man?"""
0	3748	13452	You try so hard, but you don't understand	Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
0	3749	13453	But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You sneak into the window and you say, ""Is this where it is?"""
0	3750	13454	"Somebody points his finger at you and says, ""It's his."""	"And you say, ""What's mine?"" Someone else says, ""Where what is?"""
0	3751	13455	"You say, ""Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"""	Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	3752	13456	You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,	Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
0	3753	13457	"And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?"""	"And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone."
0	3754	13458	Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
0	3755	13459	To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.	And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
0	3756	13460	You to hand over your check to taxdeductible charity organizations.	The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
0	3757	13461	He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,	And without further notice asks you how it feels
0	3758	13462	"And says, ""Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."""	Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	3759	13463	You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,	You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
0	3760	13464	There oughtta be a law against you coming around,	You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
0	3761	13465	Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	If'n you don't know by now,
0	3762	13466	It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,	It don't matter anyhow.
0	3763	13467	When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,	Look out your window, I'll be gone,
0	3764	13468	You're the reason I'm atraveling on,	Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
0	3765	13469	Don't think twice, it's alright.	It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
0	3766	13470	The light I never knowed,	And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
0	3767	13471	I'm on the dark side of the road.	Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
0	3768	13472	To try and make me change my mind and stay,	But we never did too much talking anyway,
1	3769	13473	Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,	Don't think twice, it's alright.
0	3770	13474	It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,	Like you never did before,
0	3771	13475	And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,	I can't ahear you anymore.
0	3772	13476	I'm athinking and awondering, walking all the way down the road,	I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
0	3773	13477	I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,	Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
0	3774	13478	Don't think twice, it's alright.	So, I'm awalking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
0	3775	13479	Where I'm bound I can't tell,	But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
0	3776	13480	"So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well."""	I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
0	3777	13481	You coulda done better, but I don't mind,	You just kinda wasted my precious time,
1	3778	13482	Don't think twice, it's alright,	It's alright,
1	3779	13483	It's alright,	It's alright,
1	3780	13484	It's alright,	It's alright,
1	3781	13485	It's alright,	It's alright,
1	3782	13486	It's alright,	It's alright,
1	3783	13487	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	3784	13488	Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,	Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
0	3785	13489	It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
0	3786	13490	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.	He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
0	3787	13491	"Asks you with a grin, ""Are you having a good time?"""	Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
1	3788	13492	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
0	3789	13493	Talks to servants about man and God and law,	Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
0	3790	13494	68, but says he's 24.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
0	3791	13495	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.	Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
0	3792	13496	Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.	The National Guard stands around the door.
1	3793	13497	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
1	3794	13498	I try my best to be just like I am,	Everybody wants you to be just like them,
0	3795	13499	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave  I get bored."	"Thank you, that was called ""Maggie's Farm""."
0	3796	13500	Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,	Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
0	3797	13501	I don't sense affection  no, no gratitude or love,	Your loyalty is anot to me, but to the stars above.
0	3798	13502	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
0	3799	13503	Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,	He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
0	3800	13504	He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,	His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
0	3801	13505	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
0	3802	13506	Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,	She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
0	3803	13507	And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,	But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
0	3804	13508	One more cup of coffee for the road,	One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
0	3805	13509	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	3806	13510	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall""  you thought they were all kidding you."
0	3807	13511	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out;
1	3808	13512	Now you don't talk so loud,	Now you don't seem so proud
0	3809	13513	About having to be scrounging around for your next meal 	How does it feel,
1	3810	13514	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	3811	13515	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	3812	13516	Like a rolling stone?	You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
0	3813	13517	But you know you only used to get juiced in it,	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
0	3814	13518	And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.	You said you'd never compromise
0	3815	13519	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize	He's not selling any alibis,
0	3816	13520	You stare into the vacuum of his eyes	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""
1	3817	13521	How does it feel,	How does it feel,
1	3818	13522	To be without a home,	With no direction home,
1	3819	13523	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	3820	13524	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
0	3821	13525	You never understood that it ain't no good,	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
0	3822	13526	You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat 
0	3823	13527	Ain't it hard when you discover that	He really wasn't where it's at
0	3824	13528	After he's taken everything that he can steal?	How does it feel,
1	3825	13529	How does it feel,	To be without a home,
1	3826	13530	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	3827	13531	Like a rolling stone?	Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
0	3828	13532	They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,	Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
0	3829	13533	But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.	You used to be so amused
0	3830	13534	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
0	3831	13535	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose 	You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
1	3832	13536	How does it feel,	How does it feel,
1	3833	13537	To be without a home,	With no direction home,
1	3834	13538	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	3835	13539	They say everything can be replaced,	Yet every distance is not near,
0	3836	13540	So I remember every face	Of every man who put me here.
0	3837	13541	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	3838	13542	Yonder down here in this lonely crowd	There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
0	3839	13543	All day long I hear him crying out so loud,	Crying out that he been framed.
0	3840	13544	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
0	3841	13545	They say every man need protection,	They tell me every man must fall,
0	3842	13546	But I swear I see my reflection	Somewhere so high above this wall.
0	3843	13547	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
1	3844	13548	I shall be released,	I shall be released,
1	3845	13549	I shall be released,	I shall be released.
0	3846	13550	Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.	Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
0	3847	13551	Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?	I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
0	3848	13552	Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?	Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
0	3849	13553	When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?	Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
0	3850	13554	Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?	Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
0	3851	13555	I've been in and out of happiness,	I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
0	3852	13556	And I've never been too impressed.	Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
0	3853	13557	If I'm a fool, you can have the night  you can have the morning, too.	Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
0	3854	13558	Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?	Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
0	3855	13559	Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?	Thank you.
0	3856	13560	Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,	I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
0	3857	13561	I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.	Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
0	3858	13562	You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,	I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
0	3859	13563	Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,	But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
0	3860	13564	I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.	"Now, my mama always said, ""Someday, trueyou gotta follow your heart,"
0	3861	13565	You'll be grand at the end of the line:	All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
0	3862	13566	"Just don't put your horse in front of your cart,"" ohh!"	Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a twoday ride,
0	3863	13567	But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,	I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
1	3864	13568	Going,	Going, going, gone,
1	3865	13569	Going, going,	Going, going, gone.
0	3866	13570	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
0	3867	13571	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
0	3868	13572	How many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
1	3869	13573	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	3870	13574	How many years can a mountain exist	Before it's washed to the sea?
0	3871	13575	How many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
0	3872	13576	How many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
1	3873	13577	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	3874	13578	How many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
0	3875	13579	How many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
0	3876	13580	How many deaths will it take till he knows	Too many people have died?
1	3877	13581	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind,
1	3878	13582	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	3879	13583	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,	Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
0	3880	13584	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows	Have fallen from her curls.
1	3881	13585	She takes just like a woman	And she aches just like a woman
0	3882	13586	And she makes love just like a woman,	But she breaks just like a little girl.
0	3883	13587	Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
0	3884	13588	Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest	In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
1	3885	13589	She takes just like a woman	And she aches just like a woman
0	3886	13590	And she makes love just like a woman,	But she breaks just like a little girl.
0	3887	13591	It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
0	3888	13592	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
0	3889	13593	When we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when
0	3890	13594	I was ahungry and it was your world.	Well, you fake just like a woman
1	3891	13595	And you take just like a woman,	You even make love just like a woman,
0	3892	13596	Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,	You should not treat me like a stranger,
0	3893	13597	Our Father would not like the way that you act	And you must realize the danger.
0	3894	13598	Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?	And one deserving of affection?
0	3895	13599	And is our purpose not the same on this earth,	To love and follow His direction?
0	3896	13600	We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,	We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
0	3897	13601	Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,	Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
0	3898	13602	Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:	You may not see me tomorrow.
0	3899	13603	Here's a simple love story, happened to me.	They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
0	3900	13604	She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,	'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
0	3901	13605	And watched out for a simple twist of fate.	They walked along by the old canal, little confused  I remember well,
0	3902	13606	Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,	She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
0	3903	13607	Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.	A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
0	3904	13608	She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,	She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
0	3905	13609	And forgot about a simple twist of fate.	He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
0	3906	13610	Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,	Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
0	3907	13611	On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.	He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
0	3908	13612	Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,	Maybe he'll see her once again  how long must he wait
0	3909	13613	One more time for a simple twist of fate?	People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
0	3910	13614	She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me	'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
0	3911	13615	They call, that simple twist of fate.	Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
0	3912	13616	This is from the Mojave Desert.	"""There must be some way outta here,"" said the joker to the thief,"
0	3913	13617	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief."	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
0	3914	13618	"None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."""	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"
0	3915	13619	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
0	3916	13620	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."""	All along the watchtower princes kept the view
0	3917	13621	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
0	3918	13622	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.	Thanks.
0	3919	13623	The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organgrinder sighs,	The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
0	3920	13624	The cracked bells and washedout horns blow into my face with scorn,	But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
1	3921	13625	I want you,	I want you,
1	3922	13626	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	3923	13627	The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep	And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
0	3924	13628	And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup	And ask me to open up the gate for you.
1	3925	13629	I want you,	I want you,
1	3926	13630	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	3927	13631	Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,	True love, they've been without it,
0	3928	13632	And all their daughters put me down	'Cause I don't think about it.
0	3929	13633	I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,	She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
0	3930	13634	She is good to me, there's anothing she doesn't see,	She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
1	3931	13635	I want you,	I want you,
1	3932	13636	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	3933	13637	I ain't looking to make you cry,	See you fly or watch you die,
1	3934	13638	I don't care if you feel like me,	See like me or be like me.
1	3935	13639	All I really wanna do,	All I really wanna do,
0	3936	13640	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	3937	13641	I don't want to meet your kin,	Make you spin or do you in,
0	3938	13642	And I don't want to drag you down,	Chain you down or be your clown.
1	3939	13643	All I really wanna do,	All I really wanna do,
0	3940	13644	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you.
1	3941	13645	I don't care if you analyze me,	Categorize me or hypnotize me,
0	3942	13646	And I don't care if you feel like me,	See like me or be like me.
1	3943	13647	All I really wanna do,	All I really wanna do,
0	3944	13648	All I really wanna do	Is, baby, be friends with you,
1	3945	13649	Friends with you,	Friends with you.
0	3946	13650	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
0	3947	13651	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	3948	13652	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	3949	13653	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	3950	13654	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't fire them anymore.
0	3951	13655	That long, black train is pulling down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	3952	13656	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	3953	13657	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	3954	13658	Ma, wipe the blood from my face,	I can't see through it anymore.
0	3955	13659	It's a feeling that I just can't trace,	Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	3956	13660	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	3957	13661	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	3958	13662	"This is called ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)""."	Darkness at the break of noon
0	3959	13663	Shadows even the silver spoon,	The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
0	3960	13664	Eclipses both the sun and moon 	To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
0	3961	13665	Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,	Suicide remarks are torn
0	3962	13666	From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn	Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
0	3963	13667	He not abusy being born is abusy dying.	Temptation's page flies out the door,
0	3964	13668	You follow, find yourself at war,	Watch awaterfalls of pity roar,
0	3965	13669	Feel to moan, but unlike before	You discover that you'd just abe one more person crying.
1	3966	13670	So, don't fear if you hear	A foreign sound to your ear,
0	3967	13671	It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.	Some warn victory, some downfall,
0	3968	13672	Private reasons  great or small 	Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
0	3969	13673	To make all that should be killed to crawl,	"Others say, ""Don't hate nothing at all except ahatred."""
0	3970	13674	Disillusioned words alike abullets bark,	Human gods aim for their mark,
0	3971	13675	Make everything from toy guns that spark	To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark 
0	3972	13676	It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.	While preachers preach of evil fates,
0	3973	13677	Teachers teach that knowledge waits,	Can lead you to hundreddollar plates,
0	3974	13678	Goodness hides behind its gates,	Even the president of the United States sometimes amust have to stand naked.
0	3975	13679	But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,	It's people's games that you got to dodge,
0	3976	13680	It's alright, ma, I can make it.	Advertising signs, they con,
0	3977	13681	Con you into thinking that you're the one	That can do what's anever been done,
0	3978	13682	That can win what's anever been won 	Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
0	3979	13683	You lose yourself, but then you reappear,	You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
0	3980	13684	Alone you stand with nobody near	When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
0	3981	13685	Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.	A question in your nerves is lit,
0	3982	13686	Yet you know that there is no answer fit	To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
0	3983	13687	Keep it in your mind and don't forget	That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
0	3984	13688	But, though the masters make the rules	For the wise men and the fools,
0	3985	13689	I got nothing, ma, to live up to.	Oldlady judges watch people in pairs,
0	3986	13690	Limited in sex they dare	Push fake morals, insult, and stare
0	3987	13691	While money doesn't talk, it swears,	Obscenity  who really cares?  propaganda all is phony.
0	3988	13692	While them that defend what they cannot see	With a killer's pride, security,
0	3989	13693	It blows their minds amost abitterly,	For them that think deathdeath's honesty
0	3990	13694	Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.	My eyes collide headon with stuffed
0	3991	13695	Graveyards and false goals, I scuff	At pettiness, which plays so rough,
0	3992	13696	Walk upsidedown inside handcuffs,	Kick my legs to crash it off,
0	3993	13697	"Say, ""Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"""	And, if my thoughtdreams could be seen,
0	3994	13698	They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,	But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
0	3995	13699	Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.	May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
0	3996	13700	May you always do for others and let others do for you.	May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
1	3997	13701	And may you stay forever young,	Forever young, forever young,
0	3998	13702	May you stay forever young.	May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up ato be true,
0	3999	13703	And may you always aknow the truth and see the light surrounding you.	May you always abe courageous, stand upright and be strong,
1	4000	13704	And may you stay forever young,	Forever young, forever young,
1	4001	13705	May you stay forever young.	Forever young, forever young,
0	4002	13706	May you stay forever young.	May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
0	4003	13707	May you have a strong foundation awhen the winds of changes shift.	May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
1	4004	13708	And may you stay forever young,	Forever young, forever young,
0	4005	13709	Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song  I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.	Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
0	4006	13710	Admit that the waters around you have grown,	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
0	4007	13711	If your time to you is worth saving,	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
0	4008	13712	For the times, they are achanging.	Come, awriters and critics who prophesize with your pen,
0	4009	13713	Keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
0	4010	13714	And there's no telling awho that it's naming	For the loser now might be later to win
0	4011	13715	For the times, they are achanging.	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
0	4012	13716	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
0	4013	13717	There's a battle outside and it's raging,	It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
0	4014	13718	For the times, they are achanging.	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
0	4015	13719	And don't criticize what you can't understand.	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
0	4016	13720	Your old road is rapidly aging.	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
0	4017	13721	For the times, they are achanging.	The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
1	4018	13722	The slow one now will later be fast	As the present now will later be past.
0	4019	13723	The order is arapidly fading	And the first one now will later be last
0	4020	13724	For the times, they are achanging.	Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
0	4021	13725	You may be an ambassador to England or France,	You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
0	4022	13726	You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,	You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,

0	4049	13753	Precious angel under the sun,	How was I to know you'd be the one
0	4050	13754	To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?	How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
0	4051	13755	Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,	You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
0	4052	13756	The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived	When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?

0	4057	13761	Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:	You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
0	4058	13762	You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,	You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.

1	4251	13955	When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?	When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
0	4252	13956	Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?	"Did they hear when He told Peter, ""Peter, put up your sword""?"
1	4253	13957	When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?	When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
1	4254	13958	When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?	When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
0	4255	13959	Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,	"Saying, ""Master, tell me why a man must be born again."""
1	4256	13960	When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?	When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
1	4257	13961	When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?	When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
0	4258	13962	"When He said, ""Pick up your bed and walk!"", why must you criticize?"	"""Same thing my father do I can do likewise."""
1	4259	13963	When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?	When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
1	4260	13964	Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?	Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
0	4261	13965	The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,	Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
1	4262	13966	Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?	Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
1	4263	13967	When He rose from the dead, did they believe?	When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
0	4264	13968	"He saida, ""All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth"" "	Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
1	4265	13969	When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?	When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
0	4266	13970	If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?	Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
0	4267	13971	I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living	By the saving grace that's over me.
0	4268	13972	By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping	In a pine box for all eternity,
0	4269	13973	My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping	For the saving grace that's over me.
0	4270	13974	Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection 	Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
0	4271	13975	I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection	Is the saving grace that's over me.
0	4272	13976	Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,	But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
0	4273	13977	As I look around this world, all that I'm finding	Is the saving grace that's over me.
0	4274	13978	The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,	There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
0	4275	13979	It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it	By the saving grace that's over me.
1	4276	13980	Are you ready?	Are you ready?
1	4277	13981	Are you ready?	Are you ready?
0	4278	13982	Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?	"Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, ""Depart from Me""?"
1	4279	13983	Are you ready?	Hope you're ready.
1	4280	13984	Am I ready?	Am I ready?
1	4281	13985	Am I ready?	Am I ready?
0	4282	13986	Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?	Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
1	4283	13987	Am I ready?	I hope I'm ready.
0	4284	13988	When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a faretheewell,	Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
1	4285	13989	Are you ready?	Are you ready?
0	4286	13990	Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?	Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?

1	4290	13994	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love,
0	4291	13995	Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,	Don't need a shot of turpentine  only bring me to my knees,
1	4292	13996	Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,	Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
1	4293	13997	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
0	4294	13998	Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,	I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
0	4295	13999	What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead	Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
1	4296	14000	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
0	4297	14001	I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,	I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
0	4298	14002	Don't show me no pictureshow or give me no book to read,	It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
1	4299	14003	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
0	4300	14004	Why would I want to take your life?	You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
0	4301	14005	Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,	Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
1	4302	14006	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
0	4303	14007	Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,	Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
0	4304	14008	There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:	Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
1	4305	14009	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
0	4306	14010	What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?	Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
0	4307	14011	Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,	My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
1	4308	14012	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love.
1	4309	14013	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love,
1	4310	14014	I need a shot of love,	I need a shot of love,
0	4311	14015	Heart of mine, be still,	You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
1	4312	14016	Don't let her know,	Don't let her know that you love her,
0	4313	14017	Don't be a fool, don't be blind,	Heart of mine.
0	4314	14018	Heart of mine, go back home,	You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
1	4315	14019	Don't let her see,	Don't let her see that you need her,
0	4316	14020	Don't put yourself over the line,	Heart of mine.
0	4317	14021	Heart of mine, go back where you been,	It only trouble for you if you let her in.
1	4318	14022	Don't let her hear,	Don't let her hear where you're going,
0	4319	14023	Don't untie the ties that bind,	Heart of mine.
0	4320	14024	Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,	Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
1	4321	14025	Don't let yourself fall,	Don't let yourself stumble,
0	4322	14026	You can't do the time, don't do the crime,	Heart of mine.
0	4323	14027	Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,	Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
0	4324	14028	Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,	Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
1	4325	14029	He's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4326	14030	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
0	4327	14031	Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,	Hope he falls upon himself  oh, won't that be sweet? 
0	4328	14032	Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,	Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
1	4329	14033	He's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4330	14034	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
0	4331	14035	When the whip that's akeeping you in line doesn't make him jump,	Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
0	4332	14036	Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve	Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
1	4333	14037	He's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4334	14038	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
0	4335	14039	Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,	Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
0	4336	14040	Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,	'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairytales, say he's failed to make you smile.
0	4337	14041	But he's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4338	14042	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
0	4339	14043	Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,	You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
0	4340	14044	But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,	What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
1	4341	14045	He's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4342	14046	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
1	4343	14047	He's the property of Jesus,	Resent him to the bone,
1	4344	14048	You got something better,	You got a heart of stone.
0	4345	14049	Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,	Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
1	4346	14050	He was an outlaw, that's for sure,	More of an outlaw than you ever were.
0	4347	14051	Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.	Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
0	4348	14052	But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.	Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
0	4349	14053	He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.	He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
0	4350	14054	Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,	He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
0	4351	14055	I rode with him in a taxi once	Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
0	4352	14056	Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.	They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
0	4353	14057	He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.	They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
0	4354	14058	He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.	Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
0	4355	14059	Love that's pure hopes all things,	Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
0	4356	14060	Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,	Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
0	4357	14061	You don't want a love that's pure,	You wanna drown love,
0	4358	14062	You want a watereddown love.	Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
0	4359	14063	Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,	Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
0	4360	14064	Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.	You don't want a love that's pure,
1	4361	14065	You wanna drown love,	You want a watereddown love.
0	4362	14066	Love that's pure won't lead you astray,	Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
0	4363	14067	Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,	Will nonot make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
0	4364	14068	You don't want a love that's pure,	You wanna drown love,
0	4365	14069	You want a watereddown love.	Love that's pure no accident,
0	4366	14070	It knows that it knows, is always content,	An eternal flame quietly burning,
0	4367	14071	Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.	You don't want a love that's pure,
1	4368	14072	You wanna drown love,	You want a watereddown love.
1	4369	14073	Watereddown love,	You want watereddown love,
1	4370	14074	Watereddown love,	You want watereddown love,
0	4371	14075	Yes, you do, you know you do.	Watereddown love,
0	4372	14076	Oh, you want watereddown love,	Yes, you do, you know you do.
1	4373	14077	Watereddown love,	Ooh, watereddown love,
0	4374	14078	Yes, you do, you know you do.	Watereddown love,
0	4375	14079	Ooh, you want watereddown love,	Yes, you do, you know you do.
1	4376	14080	Watereddown love,	Oh, watereddown love,
0	4377	14081	You want watereddown love,	Yes, you do, you know you do...
0	4378	14082	Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,	Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
0	4379	14083	Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,	Been treated like a farm animal on a wildgoose chase.
0	4380	14084	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	4381	14085	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
0	4382	14086	Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.	Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
0	4383	14087	'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
0	4384	14088	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
0	4385	14089	Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,	Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
0	4386	14090	But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,	I'd adone anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
0	4387	14091	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	4388	14092	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
0	4389	14093	I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,	There's a wall between youwhat you want and you got to leap it:
0	4390	14094	Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
0	4391	14095	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
0	4392	14096	Cities on fire, phones outta order,	They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
0	4393	14097	What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.	She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
0	4394	14098	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	4395	14099	Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,	Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
0	4396	14100	Never being able to separate the good from the bad,	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
0	4397	14101	Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,	Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
0	4398	14102	Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.	Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
0	4399	14103	The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
0	4400	14104	Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,	Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
0	4401	14105	The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,	The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
0	4402	14106	The race of the engine that overrules your heart 	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
0	4403	14107	Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,	Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
0	4404	14108	What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?	My back's to the wall: where can I run?
0	4405	14109	The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
0	4406	14110	Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,	Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
1	4407	14111	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
1	4408	14112	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,	Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
0	4409	14113	I was in your presence for an hour or so 	Or was it a day? I truly don't know ,
0	4410	14114	Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,	By that soft and shining sea.
0	4411	14115	Did you respect me for what I did?	Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
0	4412	14116	Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid	Of everything you see?
1	4413	14117	In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,	In the summertime when you were with me.
0	4414	14118	I got the heart and you got the blood,	We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
0	4415	14119	Then came the warning that was before the flood	That set everybody free.
0	4416	14120	Fools, they made a mock of sin,	Our loyalty they tried to win,
0	4417	14121	But you were closer to me than my next of kin	When they didn't wanna know or see.
1	4418	14122	In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,	In the summertime when you were with me.
0	4419	14123	Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,	Poverty and shame was theirs,
0	4420	14124	But all that suffering was not to be compared	With the glory that is to be.
0	4421	14125	And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,	It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
1	4422	14126	It'll be with me unto the grave	And then unto eternity.
1	4423	14127	In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,	In the summertime when you were with me.
0	4424	14128	Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,	You got your rabbit's foot, you got your goodluck charm,
0	4425	14129	But they can't help you none when there's trouble,	Trouble,
0	4426	14130	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.	Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
0	4427	14131	Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,	Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
0	4428	14132	Trouble,	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
0	4429	14133	Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,	Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
0	4430	14134	You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,	Trouble,
0	4431	14135	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.	Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
0	4432	14136	You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?	Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
0	4433	14137	Trouble,	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
0	4434	14138	Nightclubs of the brokenhearted, stadiums of the damned,	Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
0	4435	14139	Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,	Trouble,
0	4436	14140	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.	Trouble,
0	4437	14141	Trouble,	Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
0	4438	14142	In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,	When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
0	4439	14143	There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,	Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
0	4440	14144	Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,	Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
0	4441	14145	In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand	In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
0	4442	14146	Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,	Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
0	4443	14147	And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,	To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
0	4444	14148	I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame	And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
0	4445	14149	Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand	That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
0	4446	14150	I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,	In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
0	4447	14151	In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,	In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
0	4448	14152	I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,	Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
0	4449	14153	I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man	Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
0	4450	14154	Standing on the water, casting your bread	While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
0	4451	14155	Distant ships sailing in through the mist,	You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
0	4452	14156	Freedom, just around the corner for you,	But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
0	4453	14157	Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,	Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
0	4454	14158	Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.	So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
0	4455	14159	You rise up and say goodbye to no one.	Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
0	4456	14160	Both of their futures so full of dread  you don't show one.	Shedding off one more layer of skin,

0	4520	14224	He's the neighborhood bully.	What's anybody indebted to him for?
0	4521	14225	"""Nothing,"" they say, ""He just like to cause war."""	It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,

0	4655	14359	68, but says she's 24.	I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
1	4656	14360	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,	No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	4657	14361	Well, I try my best to be just like I am,	Everybody wants you to be just like them,
0	4658	14362	"They say ""Sing!"" while you slave  I get bored."	I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
0	4659	14363	Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.	Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
0	4660	14364	In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed	To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
0	4661	14365	I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.	"I and I, one said to the other, ""No man see my face and live."""
0	4662	14366	I think I'll go out and go for a walk 	Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
0	4663	14367	If she wake up now, you know, she'll just awant me to talk.	I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
0	4664	14368	I and I, in creation where one's anature neither honor, nor forgive.	"I and I, one said to the other, ""No man see my face and live."""
0	4665	14369	Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,	And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
0	4666	14370	The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.	She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
0	4667	14371	I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.	"I and I, one said to the other, ""No man see my face and live."""
0	4668	14372	Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,	Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
0	4669	14373	Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.	I've made shoes for everyone  even you  while I still go barefoot.
0	4670	14374	I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.	"I and I, one said to the other, ""No man see my face and live."""
0	4671	14375	Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please	And, if things don't change soon, he will.
0	4672	14376	Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.	Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
0	4673	14377	"She say, ""Who take away his license to kill?"""	Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
0	4674	14378	And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.	Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
0	4675	14379	Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,	"She say, ""Who take away his license to kill?"""
0	4676	14380	Well, he's hellbent for destruction, he's afraid and confused	And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
0	4677	14381	All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.	Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
0	4678	14382	"She'll say, ""Who take away his license to kill?"""	May be noisemaker, spiritmaker,
0	4679	14383	Heartbreaker, backbreaker,	Leave no stone unturned.
0	4680	14384	May be an actor in a plot,	That might be all that you got
0	4681	14385	Till your error you clearly learn.	Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
0	4682	14386	And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.	Man is opposed to fair play:
0	4683	14387	He wants it all and he wants it his way.	Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
0	4684	14388	"She say, ""Who take away his license to kill?"""	Thank you.
0	4685	14389	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
1	4686	14390	I'm not the one you want, babe.	I'm not the one you need.
0	4687	14391	You say you're looking for someone	Never weak, but always strong,
0	4688	14392	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
0	4689	14393	Someone to open each and every door.	But, it ain't me, babe,
0	4690	14394	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.	Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
0	4691	14395	Step lightly on the ground.	I'm not the one you want, babe,
0	4692	14396	I would only let you down.	You say you're looking for someone
0	4693	14397	Who will promise never to part,	Someone to close his eyes for you,
0	4694	14398	Someone to close his heart,	Someone who will die for you and more.
1	4695	14399	But, it ain't me, babe,	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
0	4696	14400	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.	Go melt back into the night, babe,
0	4697	14401	Everything inside is made of stone.	There's nothing in here moving
0	4698	14402	And, anyway, I'm not alone.	You say you're looking for someone
0	4699	14403	Pick you up every time you fall,	Someone to get you flowers constantly
0	4700	14404	And to come every time you call,	A lover for your life, but nothing more.
1	4701	14405	And it ain't me, babe,	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
0	4702	14406	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was alaying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
0	4703	14407	Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
0	4704	14408	And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,	Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
0	4705	14409	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
0	4706	14410	He left her penniless in a state of regret  it was time to bust outta the cage.	And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
0	4707	14411	Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.	She turned around to look at him as he was awalking away,
0	4708	14412	"Saying, ""I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."""	"He said, ""That's alright, babe, I love you too,"
0	4709	14413	"But we were tangled up in blue."""	He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
0	4710	14414	One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split	And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
0	4711	14415	He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.	And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
0	4712	14416	He had aone too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined  all except for you,	But you were tangled up in blue.
0	4713	14417	She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,	I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
0	4714	14418	Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,	"She was standing there right beside my chair, said, ""What's that you got up your sleeve?"""
0	4715	14419	"I said, ""Nothing, baby, and that's for sure."" She leaned down into my face,"	I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
0	4716	14420	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
0	4717	14421	There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,	Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
0	4718	14422	The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.	And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
0	4719	14423	I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,	Tangled up in blue.
0	4720	14424	So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,	I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
0	4721	14425	Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,	All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
0	4722	14426	Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,	We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
0	4723	14427	Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,	You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombsa,
0	4724	14428	You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,	I just want you to know I can asee through your mask.
0	4725	14429	You that never done nothing but build to destroy,	You play with my world like it's your little toy,
0	4726	14430	Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,	And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets afly.
0	4727	14431	Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,	A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
0	4728	14432	But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain	Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
0	4729	14433	You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,	Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
0	4730	14434	You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood	Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
0	4731	14435	Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?	Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
0	4732	14436	I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,	All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
0	4733	14437	And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,	I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
0	4734	14438	And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed	And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
0	4735	14439	You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,	"See somebody naked, you say, ""Who is that man?"""
0	4736	14440	You try so hard, but you don't understand	What you'll say when you get home.
0	4737	14441	Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	"You hand in a back door to go""Is thisthis where it is?"""
0	4738	14442	"Somebody points his finger at you and says, ""It's his."""	"You say, ""What's mine?"" Someone else says, ""Where what is?"""
0	4739	14443	"You say, ""Oh, no, am I here all alone?"""	Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	4740	14444	You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,	Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
0	4741	14445	"And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?"""	"You say, ""Impossible!"" as he hand you aa bone."
0	4742	14446	Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?	You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
0	4743	14447	Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.	No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
0	4744	14448	You to sign your check to taxdeductible charity organizations, oh!	You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
0	4745	14449	You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.	There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
0	4746	14450	Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.	Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
0	4747	14451	If you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	4748	14452	Remember me to one who lives there 	She once was a true love of mine.
0	4749	14453	If you go when the snowflakes storm,	When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
0	4750	14454	See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm	To keep her from the howling winds.
0	4751	14455	See for me if her hair is hanging long,	If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
0	4752	14456	See for me if her hair is hanging long 	That's the way I remember her best.
0	4753	14457	I'm awondering if she remembers me at all,	Many times I've often prayed
1	4754	14458	In the darkness of my night,	In the brightness of my day.
0	4755	14459	So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,	Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
0	4756	14460	Remember me to one who lives there 	She once was a true love of mine.
0	4757	14461	Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,	The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
0	4758	14462	Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,	But the town has no need to be nervous.
0	4759	14463	Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits	To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
0	4760	14464	A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits	At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
0	4761	14465	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
0	4762	14466	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues  oh, well!	The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
0	4763	14467	"Screaming, she moans, ""I've just been made!"""	Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
0	4764	14468	"Saying, ""Don't let the boys in."""	Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
0	4765	14469	Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:	"""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,"
0	4766	14470	"You won't die, it's not poison!"""	Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
0	4767	14471	Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues  oh, ah! Yeah!
0	4768	14472	John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,	Looks at his hero, the CommanderinChief.
0	4769	14473	"""Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,"	"Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"""
0	4770	14474	Well, the CommanderinChief answers him while chasing a fly.	"""Death to all those thatwho would whimper and cry!"""
0	4771	14475	Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.	"""The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"""
0	4772	14476	Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
0	4773	14477	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues  oh, well!	Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
0	4774	14478	Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,	National Bank is selling roadmaps to the soul
0	4775	14479	To the old folks' home and the college.	Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
0	4776	14480	That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,	Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
0	4777	14481	Of your useless and pointless knowledge.	Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
0	4778	14482	Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues  oh, yeah!
0	4779	14483	Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.	I said I'd send for you and I did  what did you expect?
0	4780	14484	My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.	I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
0	4781	14485	I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.	Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
0	4782	14486	I'm gonna get my coat  I feel the breath of a storm.	There's something I've gotta do tonight  you go inside and stay warm.
1	4783	14487	Has anybody seen my love?	Has anybody seen my love?
1	4784	14488	Has anybody seen my love?	I don't know.
0	4785	14489	Has anybody seen my love?	You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
0	4786	14490	Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.	I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
0	4787	14491	Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep	In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
0	4788	14492	"She said, ""Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."""	You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
0	4789	14493	But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.	Has anybody seen my love?
1	4790	14494	Ah, has anybody seen my love?	Has anybody seen my love?
1	4791	14495	I don't know.	Has anybody seen my love?
0	4792	14496	Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,	"There's just a hotblooded singer singing ""Memphis in June"","
0	4793	14497	And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powderblue wig.	Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
0	4794	14498	I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,	What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
1	4795	14499	I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,	I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
1	4796	14500	Has anybody seen my love?	Has anybody seen my love?
1	4797	14501	Has anybody seen my love?	I don't know.
1	4798	14502	Has anybody seen my love?	Baby, baby.
1	4799	14503	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby.
1	4800	14504	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby.
1	4801	14505	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby.
1	4802	14506	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby.
1	4803	14507	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby.
1	4804	14508	Honey, baby.	Baby, baby...
0	4805	14509	Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.	I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
0	4806	14510	From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,	I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
0	4807	14511	Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?	Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
0	4808	14512	Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,	I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last  oh!
0	4809	14513	I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.	At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
0	4810	14514	Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,	But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
0	4811	14515	When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,	You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
0	4812	14516	Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble  trouble always comes to pass,	All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last  oh, yes, I am!
0	4813	14517	Well, I'm gonna quit this babytalk now  I guess I should have known.	I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
0	4814	14518	Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,	I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last  oh, yes, I am!
0	4815	14519	I'll remember you	When I've forgotten all the rest.
1	4816	14520	You to me were true,	You to me were the best.
1	4817	14521	When there is no more,	You cut to the core
1	4818	14522	Quicker than anyone I knew.	When I'm all alone
1	4819	14523	In the great unknown,	I'll remember you.
1	4820	14524	I'll remember you	At the end of the trail.
1	4821	14525	I had so much left to do,	I had so little time to fail.
1	4822	14526	There's some people that	You don't forget
0	4823	14527	Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.	When the roses fade
1	4824	14528	And I'm in the shade,	I'll remember you.
1	4825	14529	Didn't Ididn't I try to love you?	Didn't Ididn't I try to care?
0	4826	14530	Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you	With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
0	4827	14531	I'll remember you	When the wind blows through the piney wood.
1	4828	14532	It was you who came right through,	It was you who understood.
1	4829	14533	Though I'd never say	That I done it the way
0	4830	14534	That you'd have liked me to,	In the end,
1	4831	14535	My dear, sweet friend,	I'll remember you.
0	4832	14536	Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust 	Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
0	4833	14537	They took a cleancut kid	And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4834	14538	They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,	They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
0	4835	14539	They took a cleancut kid,	But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4836	14540	He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,	When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
0	4837	14541	He was a cleancut kid	And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4838	14542	"They said, ""Listen, boy, you're just a pup"","	They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
0	4839	14543	They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,	Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
0	4840	14544	"They said ""Congratulations, you got what it takes"","	They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
0	4841	14545	They took a cleancut kid	And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4842	14546	He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,	Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
0	4843	14547	He drank CocaCola, he was eating Wonder Bread,	He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
0	4844	14548	He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,	He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
0	4845	14549	They took a cleancut kid,	But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4846	14550	He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,	He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
0	4847	14551	He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day	Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
0	4848	14552	His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,	They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
0	4849	14553	They took a cleancut kid	And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4850	14554	Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:	All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
0	4851	14555	They took his head and turned it inside out,	He never did know what it was all about.
0	4852	14556	He had a steady job, he joined the choir,	He never did plan to walk the high wire.
0	4853	14557	They took a cleancut kid	And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
0	4854	14558	Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,	And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
0	4855	14559	You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,	I ain't never gonna be the same again.
0	4856	14560	Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,	Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
0	4857	14561	But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend	I ain't never gonna be the same again.
0	4858	14562	You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.	Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
0	4859	14563	You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,	Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
0	4860	14564	You took my reality and cast it to the wind	And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
1	4861	14565	Come on, baby.	Come on, darling.
1	4862	14566	You're too hot, darling.	Come on, baby.
1	4863	14567	Come on, honey.	You're my baby.
1	4864	14568	You're my honey.	You got it, baby.
0	4865	14569	Trust yourself,	Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
0	4866	14570	Trust yourself,	Trust yourself to do what's right and not be secondguessed.
0	4867	14571	Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.	If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
0	4868	14572	Trust yourself,	Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
0	4869	14573	Trust yourself,	Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
0	4870	14574	Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.	If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
0	4871	14575	Well, you're on your own  you always were  in a land of wolves and thieves,	Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
0	4872	14576	Oh, trust yourself	And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
0	4873	14577	Trust yourself	And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
0	4874	14578	Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.	If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
1	4875	14579	Oh, you got to trust yourself.	Oh, you got to trust yourself.
1	4876	14580	Oh, you got to trust yourself.	Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
1	4877	14581	Oh, you got to trust yourself.	Oh, you got to trust yourself.
1	4878	14582	Trust yourself.	Trust yourself.
1	4879	14583	Trust yourself.	Oh, you got to trust yourself...
0	4880	14584	Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,	Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
0	4881	14585	I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,	But I will always be emotionally yours.
0	4882	14586	Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,	Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
0	4883	14587	I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for	And I will always be emotionally yours.
0	4884	14588	It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,	I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
0	4885	14589	Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,	Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
0	4886	14590	I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,	But I will always be emotionally yours.
0	4887	14591	Look out across the fields, see me returning,	Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
0	4888	14592	From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,	You've had time to think about it for a while.
0	4889	14593	Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,	It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
0	4890	14594	It won't matter who loves who  you'll love me or I'll love you 	When the night comes falling,
1	4891	14595	When the night comes falling,	When the night comes falling from the sky.
0	4892	14596	I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,	Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
0	4893	14597	Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting	With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
0	4894	14598	I can't provide for you no easy answers.	Who are you that I should have to lie?
0	4895	14599	You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove	When the night comes falling,
1	4896	14600	When the night comes falling,	When the night comes falling from the sky.
0	4897	14601	I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,	You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
0	4898	14602	I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,	I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
0	4899	14603	I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,	For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
0	4900	14604	Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you	When the night comes falling,
1	4901	14605	When the night comes falling,	When the night comes falling from the sky.
0	4902	14606	In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,	It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
0	4903	14607	I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,	I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
0	4904	14608	For all eternity I think I will remember	That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
0	4905	14609	You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind	When the night comes falling,
1	4906	14610	When the night comes falling,	When the night comes falling from the sky.
0	4907	14611	Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,	But you were gambling for support,
0	4908	14612	This time tomorrow I'll know you better	When my memory is not so short.
0	4909	14613	This time I'm asking for freedom,	Freedom from a world which you deny,
0	4910	14614	And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow	When the night comes falling,
1	4911	14615	When the night comes falling,	When the night comes falling from the sky.
0	4912	14616	Something is burning, baby, are you aware?	Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
0	4913	14617	Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.	Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
0	4914	14618	You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,	The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
0	4915	14619	What's your position, baby? What's going on?	Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
0	4916	14620	I know everything about this place  or so it seems 	But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
0	4917	14621	Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:	What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
0	4918	14622	Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,	Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
0	4919	14623	I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.	Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
0	4920	14624	We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,	Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
0	4921	14625	But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?	Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
0	4922	14626	I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,	I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
0	4923	14627	You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,	You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
0	4924	14628	Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?	Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
0	4925	14629	Answer me, baby  a casual look will do:	Just what in the world has come over you?
0	4926	14630	I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,	I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
0	4927	14631	I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,	I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
0	4928	14632	Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,	There's a man going 'round calling names.
0	4929	14633	Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,	I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
0	4930	14634	Oh, the gentlemen are talking	And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
0	4931	14635	They're drinking up and walking	And it is time for me to slide.
0	4932	14636	I live in another world	Where life and death are memorized,
0	4933	14637	Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls	And all I see are dark eyes.
0	4934	14638	A cock is crowing far away	And another soldier's deep in prayer,
0	4935	14639	Some mother's child has gone astray,	She can't find him anywhere.
1	4936	14640	But I can hear another drum	Beating for the dead that rise,
0	4937	14641	Whom nature's beast fears as they come,	And all I see are dark eyes.
1	4938	14642	They tell me to be discreet	For all intended purposes,
0	4939	14643	They tell me revenge is sweet	And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
0	4940	14644	But I feel nothing for their game	Where beauty goes unrecognized,
1	4941	14645	All I feel is heat and flame	And all I see are dark eyes.
0	4942	14646	Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise	And a drunken man is at the wheel,
0	4943	14647	Hunger pays a heavy price	To the falling gods of speed and steel.
0	4944	14648	Oh, time is short and the days are sweet	And passion rules the arrow that flies.
1	4945	14649	A million faces at my feet,	But all I see are dark eyes.
1	4946	14650	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
0	4947	14651	Whatever colors you have in your mind,	I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
0	4948	14652	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	4949	14653	Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.	His clothes are dirty, but hishis hands are clean
0	4950	14654	And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.	Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
0	4951	14655	Why wait any longer for the world to begin?	You can have your cake and eat it too.
0	4952	14656	Why wait any longer for the one you love	When he's standing in front of you?
0	4953	14657	Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.	Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
1	4954	14658	I long to see you in the morning light,	I long to reach for you in the night.
0	4955	14659	I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.	Baby, let me follow you down,
0	4956	14660	Baby, let me follow you down,	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	4957	14661	If you just let me follow you down.	Can I come home with you?
0	4958	14662	Baby, can I come home with you?	Yes, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	4959	14663	If you just let me come home with you.	Baby, let me follow you down,
0	4960	14664	Baby, let me follow you down.	Well, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	4961	14665	If you just let me follow you down.	Yes, I'll do anything in this GodAlmighty world
0	4962	14666	If not for you,	Babe, I couldn't find the door,
1	4963	14667	Couldn't even see the floor,	I'd be sad and blue,
1	4964	14668	If not for you.	If not for you,
0	4965	14669	Babe, I'd lay awake all night,	Wait for the morning light
1	4966	14670	To shine in through,	But it would not be new,
1	4967	14671	If not for you.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
0	4968	14672	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
0	4969	14673	I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.	If not for you, my sky would fall,
0	4970	14674	Rain would gather, too.	Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
0	4971	14675	Oh, what would I do if not for you?	If not for you,
0	4972	14676	Winter would have no spring,	I couldn't hear the robin sing,
1	4973	14677	I just wouldn't have a clue,	Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
1	4974	14678	If not for you,	If not for you,
1	4975	14679	If not for you,	If not for you,
0	4976	14680	Close your eyes, close the door.	You don't have to worry any more.
0	4977	14681	I'll be your baby tonight.	Shut the light, shut the shade.
0	4978	14682	You don't have to be afraid.	I'll be your baby tonight.
0	4979	14683	Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away  we're gonna forget it.	That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
0	4980	14684	Kick your shoes off, do not fear.	Bring that bottle over here.
0	4981	14685	You will search, babe, at any cost,	But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
0	4982	14686	Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,	But, if I can save you any time,
0	4983	14687	Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.	I can't help it if you might think I am odd
0	4984	14688	If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.	Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
0	4985	14689	But, if I can save you any time,	Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
0	4986	14690	The train leaves at half past ten,	But it will be back in the same old spot again,
0	4987	14691	The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.	And, if I can save you any time,
0	4988	14692	Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,	And admit that the waters around you have grown,
0	4989	14693	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.	If your time to you is worth saving,
0	4990	14694	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
0	4991	14695	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
0	4992	14696	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
0	4993	14697	For the loser now will be later to win	For the times, they are achanging.
0	4994	14698	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
0	4995	14699	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.	The battle outside raging
0	4996	14700	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
0	4997	14701	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
0	4998	14702	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road is rapidly aging.
0	4999	14703	Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand	For the times, they are achanging.
0	5000	14704	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slow one now will later be fast
0	5001	14705	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
0	5002	14706	And the first one now will later be last	For the times, they are achanging.
0	5003	14707	How many roads must a man walk down	Before you call him a man?
0	5004	14708	How many seas must a white dove sail	Before she sleeps in the sand?
0	5005	14709	Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly	Before they're forever banned?
1	5006	14710	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	5007	14711	Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist	Before it is washed to the sea?
0	5008	14712	Yes, and how many years can some people exist	Before they're allowed to be free?
0	5009	14713	Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head	And pretend that he just doesn't see?
1	5010	14714	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	5011	14715	Yes, and how many times must a man look up	Before he can see the sky?
0	5012	14716	Yes, and how many ears must one man have	Before he can hear people cry?
0	5013	14717	Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows	That too many people have died?
1	5014	14718	The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,	The answer is blowing in the wind.
0	5015	14719	Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,	You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
0	5016	14720	You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,	I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
0	5017	14721	You that never done nothing but build to destroy,	You play with my world like it's your little toy,
0	5018	14722	You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes	And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
0	5019	14723	Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,	A world war can be won you want me to believe,
0	5020	14724	But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain	Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
0	5021	14725	You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,	Then you set back and watch when the deathcount gets higher
0	5022	14726	And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood	Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
0	5023	14727	You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,	Fear to bring children into the world.
0	5024	14728	For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,	You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
0	5025	14729	How much do I know, to talk out of turn?	You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
0	5026	14730	But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:	That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
0	5027	14731	Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?	Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
0	5028	14732	I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,	All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
0	5029	14733	And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,	I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
0	5030	14734	And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed	And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
0	5031	14735	William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll	With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
0	5032	14736	At a Baltimore hotel society gathering	And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
0	5033	14737	As they rode him in custody down to the station	And booked William Zantzinger for firstdegree murder.
0	5034	14738	But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
0	5035	14739	William Zantzinger, who at twentyfour years	Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
0	5036	14740	With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him	And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
0	5037	14741	Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders	And swearwords and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
0	5038	14742	And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.	But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
0	5039	14743	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.	Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
0	5040	14744	She was fiftyone years old and gave birth to ten children,	Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
0	5041	14745	And never sat once at the head of the table	And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
0	5042	14746	Who just cleaned up all the food from the table	And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
0	5043	14747	Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane	That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
0	5044	14748	Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,	And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
0	5045	14749	And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,	Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
0	5046	14750	In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel	To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
0	5047	14751	And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded	And that even the nobles get properly handled
0	5048	14752	Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em	And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
0	5049	14753	Stared at the person who killed for no reason,	Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
0	5050	14754	And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,	And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
0	5051	14755	William Zantzinger with a sixmonth sentence.	Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
0	5052	14756	Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5053	14757	Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5054	14758	Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5055	14759	Joliet prison and ninetynine years 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5056	14760	Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5057	14761	Manslaughter in the highest of degrees 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5058	14762	I sat down and wrote the best words I could write 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5059	14763	Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5060	14764	Without a reply I left by the moon 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5061	14765	And was in his chambers by the next afternoon 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5062	14766	"""Could you tell me the facts,"" I said without fear "	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5063	14767	"""That a friend of mine would get ninetynine years?"" "	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5064	14768	A crash on the highway flew the car to a field 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5065	14769	There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5066	14770	But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5067	14771	And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5068	14772	The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5069	14773	"Saying, ""The witness who saw, he left little doubt"" "	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5070	14774	That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5071	14775	But ninetynine years he just don't deserve 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5072	14776	Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5073	14777	The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5074	14778	But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5075	14779	What happened to him could happen to anyone 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5076	14780	At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5077	14781	"Saying, ""Could you kindly leave my office now, please?"" "	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5078	14782	The room was funny and I stood up so slow 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5079	14783	With no other choice except but for to go 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5080	14784	I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5081	14785	I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand 	Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
0	5082	14786	I played my guitar through the night to the day 	Turn, turn, turn again 
0	5083	14787	And the only tune my guitar could play	"Was, ""Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."""
0	5084	14788	I got mixed up confusion, man, it's akilling me,	Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
0	5085	14789	Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,	I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
0	5086	14790	Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,	Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
0	5087	14791	But I'm walking and wandering  my poor feet don't ever stop! 	Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
0	5088	14792	The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,	The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
0	5089	14793	The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,	But the town has no need to be nervous.
0	5090	14794	The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits	To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
0	5091	14795	A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits	At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
0	5092	14796	Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
0	5093	14797	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
0	5094	14798	"Screaming, she moans, ""I have just been made!"""	Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
0	5095	14799	"And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in."""	Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
0	5096	14800	He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,	"""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,"
0	5097	14801	"You will not die, it's not poison!"""	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,

0	5105	14809	Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,	Puts the piedpipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
0	5106	14810	Then sends 'em out to the jungle.	Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
0	5107	14811	With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps	With a fantastic collection of stamps

0	5112	14816	I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,	I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
0	5113	14817	Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.	He could die happily ever after.
0	5114	14818	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,	Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
0	5115	14819	I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.	Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
0	5116	14820	Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole	And the National Bank at a profit sells roadmaps for the soul
0	5117	14821	To the old folks' home and the college.	I wish I could write you a melody so plain
0	5118	14822	That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,	That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
0	5119	14823	Of your useless and pointless knowledge.	Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,

0	5121	14825	Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,	Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
0	5122	14826	Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,	Been treated like a farm animal on a wildgoose chase.
0	5123	14827	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	5124	14828	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
0	5125	14829	Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.	Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
0	5126	14830	'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
0	5127	14831	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
0	5128	14832	Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,	Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
0	5129	14833	But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,	I'd adone anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
0	5130	14834	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	5131	14835	See the groom still waiting at the altar.	Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
0	5132	14836	I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,	There's a wall between youwhat you want and you got to leap it:
0	5133	14837	Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
0	5134	14838	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,	See the groom still waiting at the altar.
0	5135	14839	Cities on fire, phones outta order,	They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
0	5136	14840	What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.	She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
0	5137	14841	West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,	I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
0	5138	14842	You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,	You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
1	5139	14843	I just can't do what I've done before,	I just can't beg you anymore,
1	5140	14844	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	5141	14845	Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	5142	14846	You say you're shaking and you're always abreaking, but you know how hard you try,	You say you're assuming that you're kind of ahurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
0	5143	14847	Sometimes it gets so hard to care 	It can't be this way everywhere 
1	5144	14848	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	5145	14849	Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	5146	14850	The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,	But he's badlybuilt and he walks on stilts  watch out he don't fall on you.
0	5147	14851	You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,	Say you got some otherother kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
0	5148	14852	You say my kisses aren't like his 	Yeah, andwell, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
1	5149	14853	I'm gonna let you pass,	Yes, and I'll go last,
0	5150	14854	Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,	When you go your way and I go mine.
0	5151	14855	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	5152	14856	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they were all kidding you."
0	5153	14857	You used to laugh about	Everybody that was hanging out.
1	5154	14858	Now you don't talk so loud.	Now you don't seem so proud
0	5155	14859	About having to be scrounging your next meal.	How does it feel?
1	5156	14860	How does it feel	To be without a home,
1	5157	14861	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	5158	14862	Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,	But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
0	5159	14863	Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street	And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
0	5160	14864	You said you'd never compromise	With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
0	5161	14865	He's not selling any alibis	As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
0	5162	14866	"And say, ""Do you want to make a deal?"""	How does it feel?
1	5163	14867	How does it feel	To be on your own,
1	5164	14868	With no direction home,	A complete unknown,
0	5165	14869	Like a rolling stone?	Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
0	5166	14870	On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.	You never understood that it ain't no good,
0	5167	14871	You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.	You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
0	5168	14872	Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.	Ain't it hard when you discover that
0	5169	14873	He really wasn't where it's at	After he took from you everything he could steal?
1	5170	14874	How does it feel?	How does it feel
1	5171	14875	To havebe on your own,	With no direction home,
1	5172	14876	Like a complete unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	5173	14877	Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,	They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
0	5174	14878	Exchanging all precious gifts,	But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
0	5175	14879	You used to be so amused	At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
0	5176	14880	Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.	When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
0	5177	14881	You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.	How does it feel?
1	5178	14882	Oh, how does it feel	To be on your own,
1	5179	14883	With no direction home,	Like a complete unknown,
0	5180	14884	Well, she's got jetpilot eyes from her hips on down,	All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
0	5181	14885	She's fivefeetnine and she carries a monkey wrench,	She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
0	5182	14886	She got all the downtown boys all at her command,	But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
0	5183	14887	Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum	And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
0	5184	14888	Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,	The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
0	5185	14889	Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum	And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
0	5186	14890	The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,	The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
0	5187	14891	Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum	And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
0	5188	14892	I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,	The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
0	5189	14893	Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum	And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
0	5190	14894	The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,	The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
0	5191	14895	I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,	The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
0	5192	14896	Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum	And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
1	5193	14897	Johnny's in the basement	Mixing up the medicine,
1	5194	14898	I'm on the pavement	Thinking about the government,
0	5195	14899	The man in the trenchcoat,	Badge out, laid off,
1	5196	14900	Says he's got a bad cough,	Wants to get it paid off.
1	5197	14901	Look out, kid,	It's something you did
1	5198	14902	God knows when,	But you're doing it again,
0	5199	14903	You better duck down the alleyway,	Looking for a new friend.
1	5200	14904	The man in the coonskin cap	In the pigpen
0	5201	14905	Wants eleven dollar bills,	You only got ten.
1	5202	14906	Maggie comes fleetfoot,	Face full of black soot,
1	5203	14907	Talking that the heat put	Plants in the bed, but
1	5204	14908	The phone's tapped anyway,	Maggie says that many say
0	5205	14909	They must bust in early May,	Orders from the D.A.
1	5206	14910	Look out, kid,	Don't matter what you did,
1	5207	14911	Don't walk on your tiptoes,	Don't try No Doz,
0	5208	14912	Better stay away from those	That carry 'round a firehose,
1	5209	14913	Keep a clean nose,	Watch the plainclothes,
0	5210	14914	You don't need a weatherman	To know which way the wind blows.
1	5211	14915	Ah, get sick, get well,	Hang around the inkwell,
1	5212	14916	Ring bell, hard to tell	If anything is gonna sell,
1	5213	14917	Try hard, get barred,	Get back, write Braille,
1	5214	14918	Get jailed, jump bail,	Join the army if you fail.
1	5215	14919	Look out, kid,	You're gonna get hit
1	5216	14920	By losers, cheaters,	Sixtime users
0	5217	14921	Hanging 'round the theaters,	Girl by the whirlpool's
1	5218	14922	Looking for a new fool,	Don't follow leaders,
1	5219	14923	Watch the parking meters.	Oh, get born, keep warm,
0	5220	14924	Short pants, romance, learn to dance,	Get dressed, get blessed,
0	5221	14925	Try to be a success,	Please her, please him, buy gifts,
0	5222	14926	Don't steal, don't lift,	Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
1	5223	14927	Look out, kid,	They keep it all hid,
1	5224	14928	Better jump down a manhole,	Light yourself a candle,
1	5225	14929	Don't wear sandals	And try to avoid the scandals.
1	5226	14930	Don't wanna be a bum,	You better chew gum,
1	5227	14931	I can't understand,	She let go of my hand
0	5228	14932	And left me here facing the wall.	Well, I'd sure like to know
0	5229	14933	Why she did go,	But I can't get close to her at all.
0	5230	14934	Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,	She said she would never forget,
0	5231	14935	But morning is clear	And it's like I ain't here,
0	5232	14936	She pretends like we never have met.	It's all new to me
0	5233	14937	Like some mystery,	It could even be like a myth,
1	5234	14938	But it's hard to think on	That she's the same one
0	5235	14939	That last night I was with.	Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted 
1	5236	14940	Am I still dreaming yet?	I wish she'd unlock
0	5237	14941	Her voice once and talk	'Stead of acting like we never have met.
1	5238	14942	If II didn't have to guess,	I'd gladly confess
0	5239	14943	To anything I might have tried.	If I was with her too long
0	5240	14944	Or have done something wrong,	I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
0	5241	14945	Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,	Her mouth was watery and wet,
1	5242	14946	But something has changed,	For she ain't the same,
0	5243	14947	She just acts like we never have met.	I'm leaving today,
0	5244	14948	I'll be on my way,	Of this I can't say very much,
0	5245	14949	Yes, but, if you want me to,	I can be just like you
0	5246	14950	And pretend that we never have touched,	And, if anybody asks me,
0	5247	14951	"""Is it easy to forget?"""	"I'll say, ""It's easily done,"
0	5248	14952	Just pick anyone	"And pretend that you never have met."""
0	5249	14953	Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?	We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
0	5250	14954	And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.	Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
0	5251	14955	In this room the heatpipes just cough,	The country music station plays soft,
0	5252	14956	But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,	Just Louise and her lover so entwined
0	5253	14957	And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.	In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the keychain
0	5254	14958	And the allnight girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,	We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who thatif it's them or him that's really insane.
0	5255	14959	But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,	She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
0	5256	14960	But she just makes it all too concise and too clear	That Johanna's not here.
0	5257	14961	The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face	Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
0	5258	14962	Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,	He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
0	5259	14963	And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.	He's sure got a lot of gall
0	5260	14964	To be so useless and all,	Muttering small talk at the wall
0	5261	14965	While I'm in the hall.	Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
0	5262	14966	And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.	Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
0	5263	14967	"Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while"","	But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
0	5264	14968	See the primitive wallflower freeze	When the jellyfaced women all sneeze,
0	5265	14969	"Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez,"	"I can't find my knees."""
0	5266	14970	Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,	But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
0	5267	14971	The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,	"Saying, ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."""
0	5268	14972	"But, like Louise always says, ""You can't look at much, can you, man?"" as she herself prepares for him."	And Madonna, she still has not showed,
0	5269	14973	We see this empty cage now corrode	Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
0	5270	14974	The fiddler, he now steps to the road,	"He writes ""Everything's been returned which was owed"""
0	5271	14975	On the back of the fish truck that loads	While my conscience explodes.
0	5272	14976	The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain	And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
0	5273	14977	In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,	When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
0	5274	14978	There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,	Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
0	5275	14979	Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,	Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
0	5276	14980	In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand	In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
0	5277	14981	Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,	Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
0	5278	14982	And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,	To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
0	5279	14983	I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame	And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
0	5280	14984	Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand	That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
0	5281	14985	I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,	In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
0	5282	14986	In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,	In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
0	5283	14987	I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,	Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
0	5284	14988	I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man	Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
0	5285	14989	Everybody's building the big ships and boats,	Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
0	5286	14990	Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
0	5287	14991	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	5288	14992	Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,	But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
0	5289	14993	Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
0	5290	14994	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	5291	14995	Now, lampgates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,	Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
0	5292	14996	Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,	But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
0	5293	14997	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	5294	14998	Come all without, come all within,	You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
0	5295	14999	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	5296	15000	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	5297	15001	Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,	Vanished from my hand,
0	5298	15002	Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,	My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
0	5299	15003	I have no one to meet,	And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
0	5300	15004	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	5301	15005	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	5302	15006	Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,	My senses have been stripped,
0	5303	15007	My hands can't feel to grip,	My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
1	5304	15008	I'm ready to go anywhere,	I'm ready for to fade
0	5305	15009	Into my own parade,	Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
0	5306	15010	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	5307	15011	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	5308	15012	Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,	It's not aimed at anyone,
0	5309	15013	It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.	And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
0	5310	15014	To your tambourine in time,	It's just a ragged clown behind,
0	5311	15015	I wouldn't pay it any mind,	It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
0	5312	15016	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	5313	15017	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	5314	15018	And take me disappearing through the smokerings of my mind,	Down the foggy ruins of time,
1	5315	15019	Far past the frozen leaves,	The haunted, frightened trees,
0	5316	15020	Out to the windy beach,	Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
0	5317	15021	Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,	Silhouetted by the sea,
0	5318	15022	Circled by the circus sands,	With all memory and fate
0	5319	15023	Driven deep beneath the waves,	Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
0	5320	15024	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
0	5321	15025	Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,	In the jinglejangle morning I'll come following you.
0	5322	15026	Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.	My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
0	5323	15027	When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give	And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
0	5324	15028	Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.	I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
0	5325	15029	All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.	And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
0	5326	15030	Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.	I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
0	5327	15031	Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.	And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
0	5328	15032	Go away from my window,	Leave at your own chosen speed.
1	5329	15033	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I'm not the one you need.
0	5330	15034	You say you're looking for someone	Who's never weak, but always strong,
0	5331	15035	To protect you and defend you	Whether you are right or wrong,
0	5332	15036	Someone to open each and every door.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	5333	15037	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
1	5334	15038	Go lightly from the ledge, babe,	Go lightly on the ground.
0	5335	15039	I'm not the one you want, babe,	I will only let you down.
0	5336	15040	You say you're looking for someone	Who will promise never to part,
1	5337	15041	Someone to close his eyes for you,	Someone to close his heart,
0	5338	15042	Someone who will die for you and more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	5339	15043	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	5340	15044	Go melt back in the night,	Everything inside is made of stone.
0	5341	15045	There's nothing in here moving	And, anyway, I'm not alone.
0	5342	15046	You say you're looking for someone	Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
0	5343	15047	To gather flowers constantly,	And to come each time you call,
0	5344	15048	A lover for your life and nothing more.	But it ain't me, babe,
0	5345	15049	No, no, no, it ain't me, babe	It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
0	5346	15050	You angel, you, you're as fgot me under your wing,	The way you walk and the way you talk  I feel I could almost sing.
0	5347	15051	You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,	I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
0	5348	15052	And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,	Yes, I never did feel this way before,
0	5349	15053	Never did get up and walk the floor,	If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
0	5350	15054	You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,	The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
0	5351	15055	And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,	Never did feel this way before,
0	5352	15056	Never did get up and walk the floor,	If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
0	5353	15057	You angel, you, you got me under your wing,	The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
0	5354	15058	Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,	Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
0	5355	15059	And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,	They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
1	5356	15060	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	5357	15061	It's that million dollar bash.	Everybody from right now to over there and back,
0	5358	15062	The louder they come, the bigger they crack.	Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
0	5359	15063	We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	5360	15064	Ooh, baby, oohee,	It's that million dollar bash.
0	5361	15065	Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,	Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
0	5362	15066	And along came Jones, emptied the trash,	Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
1	5363	15067	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	5364	15068	It's that million dollar bash.	Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
0	5365	15069	I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,	First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
0	5366	15070	But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	5367	15071	Ooh, baby, oohee,	It's that million dollar bash.
0	5368	15072	Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,	I punched myself in the face with my fist,
0	5369	15073	I took my potatoes down to be mashed,	And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
1	5370	15074	Ooh, baby, oohee,	Ooh, baby, oohee,
0	5371	15075	Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.	The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
0	5372	15076	For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes	And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
0	5373	15077	Your cracked countrylips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.	Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
0	5374	15078	But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.	It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
0	5375	15079	I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.	I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
0	5376	15080	You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.	Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
0	5377	15081	I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.	If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
0	5378	15082	From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,	That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
0	5379	15083	I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring	For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
0	5380	15084	Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.	And someday maybe  who knows, baby?  I'll come and be crying to you.
0	5381	15085	Our conversation was short and sweet,	It nearly swept me off of my feet 
1	5382	15086	Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,	Hmm, and you are on dry land,
1	5383	15087	You made it there somehow,	You're a big girl now.
0	5384	15088	Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,	He's singing his song for me at his own expense 
0	5385	15089	And I'm just like that bird,	Oh, singing just for you,
0	5386	15090	Hmm, I hope that you can hear,	Hear me singing through these tears.
0	5387	15091	Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,	You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days 
0	5388	15092	Oh, I know where I can find you,	Oh, in somebody's room,
0	5389	15093	Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,	You're a big girl all the way.
0	5390	15094	Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,	Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
1	5391	15095	I can change, I swear,	Hmm, see what you can do,
1	5392	15096	Hmm, I can make it through,	You can make it too.
0	5393	15097	A change in the weather can be extreme,	But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
0	5394	15098	I'm going out of my mind,	Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
0	5395	15099	Oohah, like a corkscrew to my heart	Ever since we've been apart.
0	5396	15100	My heart is telling me I love you still.	I can see the turning of the key,
0	5397	15101	I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,	I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
0	5398	15102	Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.	My patron saint is afighting with a ghost,
0	5399	15103	He's always off somewhere when I need him most,	The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
0	5400	15104	But my heart is telling me I love you still.	I come back to the town from the flaming moon
0	5401	15105	And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,	I love to see you dress before the mirror 
0	5402	15106	Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?	Everybody's wearing a disguise
0	5403	15107	To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,	But me, I can't cover what I am,
0	5404	15108	Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.	I march in the parade of liberty,
0	5405	15109	But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.	How long must I suffer such abuse?
0	5406	15110	Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?	I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
0	5407	15111	The pot of gold is only makebelieve,	The treasure can't be found by men who search,
0	5408	15112	Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.	We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
0	5409	15113	I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,	My head tells me it's time to make a change,
0	5410	15114	But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.	Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
0	5411	15115	Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl.	Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
0	5412	15116	Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,	Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
0	5413	15117	Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,	They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
0	5414	15118	And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,	Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
0	5415	15119	Tangled up in blue.	She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
0	5416	15120	I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.	We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
0	5417	15121	Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.	She turned around to look at me as I was awalking away,
0	5418	15122	"I heard her say over my shoulder, ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"	"Tangled up in blue."""
0	5419	15123	I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,	But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
0	5420	15124	So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,	Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
0	5421	15125	But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,	I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
0	5422	15126	Tangled up in blue.	She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
0	5423	15127	I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,	And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
0	5424	15128	"She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, ""Don't I know your name?"""	I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
0	5425	15129	I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,	Tangled up in blue.
0	5426	15130	She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.	"""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said, ""You look like the silent type."""
0	5427	15131	Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,	Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
0	5428	15132	And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,	Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
0	5429	15133	Tangled up in blue.	I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
0	5430	15134	There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,	Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
0	5431	15135	She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,	And, when it finallythe bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
0	5432	15136	The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,	Tangled up in blue.
0	5433	15137	So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,	All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
0	5434	15138	Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,	Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
0	5435	15139	But me, I'm still on the road, aheading for another joint,	We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
0	5436	15140	You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,	But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
0	5437	15141	Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,	Crying like a fire in the sun.
0	5438	15142	Look out, the saints are coming through	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	5439	15143	The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,	Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
0	5440	15144	The emptyhanded painter from your streets	Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
0	5441	15145	The sky too is folding under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	5442	15146	All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,	Your own emptyhanded army is all going home,
0	5443	15147	Your lover, who just walked out your door,	Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
0	5444	15148	The carpet too is moving under you,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	5445	15149	Leave your steppingstones behind, there's something that calls for you,	Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
0	5446	15150	The vagabond who's rapping at your door	Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
0	5447	15151	Strike another match, go start anew,	And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
0	5448	15152	He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,	Preoccupied with his vengeance,
0	5449	15153	Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.	You know that he has no intentions
0	5450	15154	Of looking your way, unless it's to say	That he needs you to test his inventions.
0	5451	15155	Babe, come crawl out your window,	Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
0	5452	15156	How can you say he will haunt you?	You can go back to him any time you want to.
0	5453	15157	He looks so truthful  is this how he feels? 	Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
0	5454	15158	With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,	If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
0	5455	15159	He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,	Or pick it up after he throws it.
0	5456	15160	Babe, please crawl out your window,	Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
0	5457	15161	How can you say he will haunt you?	You can go back to him any time you want to.
0	5458	15162	He look so righteous while your face is so changed	As you sit on the box you keep him in
0	5459	15163	While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange	Their religion of the little ten women
0	5460	15164	That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.	Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
0	5461	15165	Babe, please come crawl out your window,	Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
0	5462	15166	How can you say he will haunt you?	Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
0	5463	15167	You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend	If you won't come out your window.
0	5464	15168	Yes, come out your window!	Oh, my
0	5465	15169	You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,	When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
0	5466	15170	You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,	You just want to be on the side that's winning.
0	5467	15171	You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.	If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
0	5468	15172	You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,	You had no faith to lose and you know it.
0	5469	15173	I know the reason that you talk behind my back,	I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
0	5470	15174	Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact	With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
0	5471	15175	You see me on the street, you always act surprised,	"You say, ""How are you?"", ""Good luck"", but you don't mean it"
0	5472	15176	When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed 	Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
0	5473	15177	No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,	If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
0	5474	15178	And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.	Don't you understand it's not my problem?
0	5475	15179	I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes	And just for that one moment I could be you.
0	5476	15180	Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,	You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
0	5477	15181	"Here's a song about marriage. This is called ""Isis"". This is for a man if he's still here."	I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
0	5478	15182	But I could not hold on to her very long,	So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
0	5479	15183	For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.	I came to a high place of darkness and light,
0	5480	15184	The dividing line ran through the center of town,	I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
0	5481	15185	Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.	A man in the corner approached me for a match,
0	5482	15186	I knew right away he was not ordinary,	"He said, ""Are you looking for something easy to catch?"""
0	5483	15187	"I said, ""I got no money, man."" He said, ""That ain't necessary."""	We set out that night for the cold in the north,
0	5484	15188	I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,	"I said, ""Where we going?"" He said we'd be back by the fourth."
0	5485	15189	"I said, ""That's the best news that I've ever heard."""	I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
0	5486	15190	Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,	As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
0	5487	15191	I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.	She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
0	5488	15192	Things would be different the next time we wed	If only could hang on and just be her friend 
0	5489	15193	I still can't remember all the best things she said.	We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
0	5490	15194	"He said, ""There's a body I'm atrying to find."	"If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."""
0	5491	15195	'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.	Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
0	5492	15196	We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.	When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
0	5493	15197	But I made up my mind that I had to get on.	I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
0	5494	15198	There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had	When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
0	5495	15199	When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.	I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
0	5496	15200	Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.	I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
0	5497	15201	Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.	She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
0	5498	15202	Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.	I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
0	5499	15203	I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.	"She said, ""Where you been?"" I said, ""No place special."""
0	5500	15204	"She said, ""You look different."" I said, ""Well, I guess."""	"She said, ""You been gone."" I said, ""That's only natural."""
0	5501	15205	"She said, ""You gonna stay?"" I said, ""If you want me to, yes!"""	Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
0	5502	15206	What drives me to you is what drives me insane,	I still can remember the way that you smiled
0	5503	15207	She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,	From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
0	5504	15208	I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.	Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
0	5505	15209	She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain	By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
0	5506	15210	Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?	Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
0	5507	15211	Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?	Could I been used and played as a pawn?
0	5508	15212	It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on	Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
0	5509	15213	And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,	Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
0	5510	15214	And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,	Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
0	5511	15215	Sea breeze blowing, there's a hellhound loose,	Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
0	5512	15216	Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.	He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
0	5513	15217	And she had left him to die in there.	He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
0	5514	15218	The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,	Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
0	5515	15219	"Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee""."	We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
0	5516	15220	"She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing"	"You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."""
0	5517	15221	And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,	Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
0	5518	15222	Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,	Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
0	5519	15223	Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,	"Hear a voice crying ""Daddy!"" I always think it's for me,"
0	5520	15224	But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.	Every new messenger bringing evil report
0	5521	15225	'Bout armies on the march and time that is short	And famines and earthquakes and trainwrecks and tearing down of the wall.
0	5522	15226	Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?	Ever meet your accusers facetoface in the rain?
0	5523	15227	She had chromebrown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.	I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
0	5524	15228	I see a house in the country being atorn apart from within,	I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
0	5525	15229	And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,	Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
0	5526	15230	And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,	Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
0	5527	15231	Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,	Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
0	5528	15232	Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.	I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5529	15233	If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,	If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
0	5530	15234	But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.	Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
0	5531	15235	Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,	I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
0	5532	15236	In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.	Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
0	5533	15237	It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,	I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
0	5534	15238	The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.	Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
0	5535	15239	Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,	I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
0	5536	15240	So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.	Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
0	5537	15241	The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk	Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
0	5538	15242	Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?	You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
0	5539	15243	I met somebody facetoface, I had to remove my hat,	She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
0	5540	15244	It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,	But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5541	15245	Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,	It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
0	5542	15246	When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.	Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5543	15247	Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,	Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
0	5544	15248	Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.	You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5545	15249	There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.	She's the one you been wondering about, but there's areally nothing much to tell.
0	5546	15250	We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is ahistory.	Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5547	15251	So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,	The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
0	5548	15252	And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.	One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
0	5549	15253	If we never meet again, baby, remember me,	How my lone guitar played sweet for you that oldtime melody,
0	5550	15254	And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.	No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
1	5551	15255	Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milkcow low,	Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
0	5552	15256	Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,	But then againand then again, I said, ohwhoawhoaoh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
0	5553	15257	Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,	And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my ponystall,
0	5554	15258	And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,	But then again, I said, ohI said, ohI said, ohoh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
0	5555	15259	Woo!	Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
1	5556	15260	And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,	And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
0	5557	15261	But then againI think againand then thewhoaI said, ohI said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.	Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
1	5558	15262	And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,	And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
0	5559	15263	But then again, I saidagain, I said, whoawhoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.	Woo!
0	5560	15264	I said, whoawhoawhoawhoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,	I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
0	5561	15265	Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand,	"But the judge says, ""Mona can't have no bond."""
0	5562	15266	The walls collide, Mona cries.	Rainman leaves in the wolfman's disguise. Oh!
0	5563	15267	I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,	I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
0	5564	15268	Now the undertaker in his midnight suit	"Says to the madman, ""Ain't you cute!"""
0	5565	15269	The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,	"He says, ""You ain't so bad yourself!"" Oh, yeah!"
0	5566	15270	I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,	I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
0	5567	15271	Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,	She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
0	5568	15272	Rasputin, he's so dignified,	Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
0	5569	15273	I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,	I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
0	5570	15274	Alright!	Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
1	5571	15275	When she lays upon the grass,	She gets all messed up, she faints,
0	5572	15276	That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!	I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
0	5573	15277	I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!	I wanna be yours!
1	5574	15278	Alright, now!	I'll hold it down for you.
0	5575	15279	The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organgrinder cries,	The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
0	5576	15280	The cracked bells and washedout horns blow into my face with scorn,	But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
1	5577	15281	I want you,	I want you,
1	5578	15282	I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	5579	15283	The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep	And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
0	5580	15284	And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup	And ask me to open up the gate for you.
1	5581	15285	I want you,	I want you,
1	5582	15286	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	5583	15287	Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,	True love, they've been without it,
0	5584	15288	But all their daughters put me down	'Cause I don't think about it.
0	5585	15289	Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,	She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
0	5586	15290	She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,	She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
1	5587	15291	I want you,	I want you,
1	5588	15292	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	5589	15293	Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.	No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
0	5590	15294	But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,	And because time was on his side and because I
1	5591	15295	Want you,	I want you,
1	5592	15296	Yes, I want you so bad,	Honey, I want you.
0	5593	15297	Heart of mine, be still,	You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
1	5594	15298	Don't let her know,	Don't let her know that you love her,
0	5595	15299	Don't be a fool, don't be blind,	Heart of mine.
0	5596	15300	Heart of mine, go back home,	You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
1	5597	15301	Don't let her see,	Don't let her see where you're going,
0	5598	15302	Don't put yourself over the line,	Heart of mine.
0	5599	15303	Heart of mine, go back where you been,	Be only trouble for you ifa you let her in.
1	5600	15304	Don't let her know,	Don't let her know that you love her,
0	5601	15305	Don't be a fool, don't be blind,	Heart of mine.
0	5602	15306	Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,	Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
1	5603	15307	Don't let yourself fall,	Don't let yourself stumble,
0	5604	15308	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,	Heart of mine,
0	5605	15309	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,	Heart of mine,
0	5606	15310	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,	Heart of mine.
0	5607	15311	On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,	Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
0	5608	15312	We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,	It sure is right on a night like this.
0	5609	15313	On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,	Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
0	5610	15314	Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,	It sure feels right on a night like this.
0	5611	15315	On a night like this I can't get any sleep,	The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
0	5612	15316	Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,	And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
0	5613	15317	Put your body next to mine and keep me company,	There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
0	5614	15318	Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door 	If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
0	5615	15319	There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,	But it sure feels right on a night like this.
0	5616	15320	Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.	Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
0	5617	15321	But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.	She takes just like a woman  yes, she does!
0	5618	15322	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	5619	15323	Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.	Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
0	5620	15324	Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.	She takes just like a woman  yes!
0	5621	15325	She makes love just like a woman  yes, she does!	And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
0	5622	15326	It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.	And your longtime curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
0	5623	15327	I can't stay in here  ain't it clear	That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
0	5624	15328	And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,	Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
1	5625	15329	Ah, you fake just like a woman  yes, you do!	You make love just like a woman  yes, you do!
0	5626	15330	Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,	Dust on my face and my cape,
0	5627	15331	Me and Magdalena on the run,	I think this time we should escape.
0	5628	15332	Sold my guitar to the baker's son	For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
0	5629	15333	But I can get another one	And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
0	5630	15334	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	5631	15335	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	5632	15336	Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,	Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
0	5633	15337	At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,	Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
0	5634	15338	Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?	Was it my hand that held the gun?
0	5635	15339	Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,	The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
0	5636	15340	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	5637	15341	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	5638	15342	At the corrida we'll sit in the shade	And watch the young torero stand alone,
0	5639	15343	Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed	When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
0	5640	15344	The way, it is long, but the end is near,	Already the fiesta has begun,
0	5641	15345	Well, the streetsthe face of God will soon appear	With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
0	5642	15346	No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,	Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
0	5643	15347	Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,	Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
0	5644	15348	Was that the thunder that I heard?	My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
0	5645	15349	Come sit by me, don't say a word.	Oh, can it be that I am slain?
0	5646	15350	Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,	Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
0	5647	15351	Aim well, my little one,	We may not make it through the night.
0	5648	15352	Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,	Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
0	5649	15353	Seem like I been down this way before,	Is there any truth in that, Senor?
0	5650	15354	Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?	How long are we gonna be riding?
0	5651	15355	How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?	Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
0	5652	15356	There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,	There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
0	5653	15357	There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot	"Where she held me in her arms one time and said, ""Forget me not."""

0	5692	15396	They'd like to drive me from this town,	They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
1	5693	15397	Theythey show me to the door,	They say don't come back no more

0	5708	15412	Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,	We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
0	5709	15413	Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream 	Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
0	5710	15414	Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and goodlooking,	We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
0	5711	15415	Staring out the window to the stars high above 	Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
1	5712	15416	Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,	Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
0	5713	15417	Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,	Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
0	5714	15418	Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,	Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
0	5715	15419	Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day	Time passes slowly and fades away.
1	5716	15420	They say every man must need protection,	They say every man must fall,
0	5717	15421	Yet I swear I see my reflection	Some place so high above the wall.
0	5718	15422	I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	5719	15423	Down here next to me in this lonely crowd	There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
0	5720	15424	All day long I hear him cry so loud,	Calling out that he's been framed.
0	5721	15425	Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	5722	15426	Mama, take this badge off of me,	I can't use it anymore.
0	5723	15427	It's getting dark, too dark to see,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	5724	15428	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	5725	15429	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	5726	15430	Mama, put my guns in the ground,	I can't shoot them anymore.
0	5727	15431	That long, black cloud is coming down,	I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
1	5728	15432	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,
1	5729	15433	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door,	Knockknockknocking on heaven's door.
0	5730	15434	"""There must be some way outta here,"" said the joker to the thief,"	"""There's too much confusion, I can't get no release."
0	5731	15435	Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,	"None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."""
0	5732	15436	"""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,"	"""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,"
0	5733	15437	But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,	"So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."""
0	5734	15438	All along the watchtower princes kept the view	While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
0	5735	15439	Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,	Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
1	5736	15440	Well, I'm hanging on	To a solid rock,
0	5737	15441	Made before the foundation of the world,	And I won't let go and I can't let go,
1	5738	15442	Won't let go and I can't let go,	Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
0	5739	15443	For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,	For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
0	5740	15444	Nations are angry, cursed are some,	People are expecting a false peace to come.
1	5741	15445	Well, I'm hanging on	To a solid rock,
0	5742	15446	Made before the foundation ofof the world,	And I won't let go and I can't let go,
1	5743	15447	Won't let go and I can't let go,	Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
0	5744	15448	It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,	Twentyfour hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
0	5745	15449	Using every angle under the sun,	And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
1	5746	15450	Well, I'm hanging on	To a solid rock,
0	5747	15451	Made before the foundation ofof the world,	I won't let go and I can't let go,

0	5765	15469	Well, I told my baby further down the line,	"I said, ""What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."""
1	5766	15470	You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,	You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
0	5767	15471	There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,	Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
0	5768	15472	He knew the deal was adown and dirty,	Nothing wrong could make it right away,
0	5769	15473	But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,	Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
0	5770	15474	My God, they killed Him!	Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
0	5771	15475	Name of Martin Luther King,	He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
0	5772	15476	He made the bells of freedom ring today	With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
0	5773	15477	Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.	My God, they killed Him!
1	5774	15478	The only son of God Almighty,	The holy one called Jesus Christ,
0	5775	15479	He healed the sick and He fed the hungry	And for His love they took His life away
0	5776	15480	On the road to glory where the story never ends,	Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
0	5777	15481	My God, they killed Him!	There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
0	5778	15482	A man named Martin Luther King,	The only son of God Almighty,

1	5782	15486	The only son of God Almighty,	The holy one called Jesus Christ,
0	5783	15487	On the road to glory where the story never ends,	Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
0	5784	15488	My God, they killed Him!	There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
0	5785	15489	A man named Martin Luther King,	The only son of God Almighty,
0	5786	15490	The holy one called Jesus Christ.	There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
0	5787	15491	I didn't know that you'd be leaving 	Who you thought you were talking to?
0	5788	15492	I figure maybe we're even	Or maybe I'm one up on you.
1	5789	15493	I send you all my money	Just like I did before,
0	5790	15494	I tried to reach you, honey,	But you're drifting too far from shore,
1	5791	15495	Drifting too far from shore, yeah,	Drifting too far from shore.
0	5792	15496	I ain't agonna get lost in this current,	I don't like playing catandmouse.
0	5793	15497	No gentleman likes making love to a servant,	'Specially when he's in his father's house.
0	5794	15498	I never could guess your weight, baby,	Never needed to call you my whore,
0	5795	15499	I always thought you were straight, baby,	But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
1	5796	15500	Drifting too far from shore,	Drifting too far from shore,
0	5797	15501	Drifting too far from shore.	Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
0	5798	15502	The bottom of the barrel is too.	I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
0	5799	15503	Everybody can't be as lucky as you.	Never no more do I wonder
0	5800	15504	Why you don't never play with me anymore:	At any moment you could go under
0	5801	15505	'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,	Drifting too far from shore,
1	5802	15506	Drifting too far from shore,	Drifting too far from shore.
0	5803	15507	You and me, we had completeness,	I gave you all of what I could provide.
1	5804	15508	We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,	We were the wrong side.
0	5805	15509	I've already ripped out the phones, honey,	You can't walk the streets in a war.
0	5806	15510	I can finish this alone, honey,	You're drifting too far from shore.
0	5807	15511	As I travel down life's pathway,	Know not what the years may hold.
0	5808	15512	As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,	Precious memories flood my soul.
0	5809	15513	Precious memories, how they linger,	How they ever flood my soul!
0	5810	15514	In the stillness of the midnight	Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
1	5811	15515	Precious father, loving mother,	Glide across the lonely years
0	5812	15516	And old homes, scenes of my childhood	In fond memory appear.
0	5813	15517	Precious memories, how they linger,	How they ever flood my soul!
0	5814	15518	In the stillness of the midnight	Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
0	5815	15519	Precious memories, how they linger,	How they ever flood my soul!
0	5816	15520	In the stillness of the midnight	Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
0	5817	15521	Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,	When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
0	5818	15522	When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,	Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
0	5819	15523	Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,	Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
0	5820	15524	Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,	You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
0	5821	15525	Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,	You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
0	5822	15526	You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim	And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
0	5823	15527	Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,	Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
0	5824	15528	Maybe someday you will understand	That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
0	5825	15529	Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt	When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
0	5826	15530	When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,	Either one of us could do what we do best.
0	5827	15531	I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,	I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
0	5828	15532	Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say	That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
0	5829	15533	Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,	"Saying, ""For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"""
0	5830	15534	Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,	For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
0	5831	15535	Always was a sucker for the right cross,	Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
0	5832	15536	Maybe someday you will look back and see	That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
0	5833	15537	Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,	But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
0	5834	15538	Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,	There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
0	5835	15539	You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months 	I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
0	5836	15540	Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,	There was no greater love than what I had for you.
0	5837	15541	Well, there was this movie I seen one time	About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
0	5838	15542	He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.	The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
0	5839	15543	Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp	As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
0	5840	15544	"""Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square."	"I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."""
0	5841	15545	Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes arolling in	And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
0	5842	15546	You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,	The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
0	5843	15547	I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert	In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
0	5844	15548	I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet 	Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
0	5845	15549	Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'	And we slept near the Alamo  your skin was so tender and soft.
0	5846	15550	Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.	I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
0	5847	15551	Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies 	Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
0	5848	15552	But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore	To remember the times when I was your only man
0	5849	15553	And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
0	5850	15554	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
0	5851	15555	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.	Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
0	5852	15556	We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live 	He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
0	5853	15557	Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,	She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
0	5854	15558	"She says, ""Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."""	Then she told us how times were tough 
0	5855	15559	And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,	But she changed the subject every time money came up.
0	5856	15560	"She said, ""Welcome to the land of the living dead"","	But you could tell she was so brokenhearted,
0	5857	15561	"She said, ""Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."""	"""How far are you all going?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh."
0	5858	15562	"""We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,"	"Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."""
0	5859	15563	"Ruby just smiled and said, ""Ah, you know some babies never learn."""	Something about that movie, though  but I just can't get it outta my head 
0	5860	15564	But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.	All I remember about it wasis Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
0	5861	15565	And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
0	5862	15566	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
0	5863	15567	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.	Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
0	5864	15568	I was crossing the street when shots rang out.	I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
0	5865	15569	"""We got him cornered in the churchyard!"" I heard somebody shout."	Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
0	5866	15570	"Underneath it it said, ""A man with no alibi""."	You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
0	5867	15571	Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,	It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
0	5868	15572	Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,	But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
0	5869	15573	Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,	You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
0	5870	15574	I could feel a whole lot better	If you were just here by my side to show me how.
0	5871	15575	Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,	Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
0	5872	15576	He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,	But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
0	5873	15577	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
0	5874	15578	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
0	5875	15579	You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.	The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter 
0	5876	15580	Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.	And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
0	5877	15581	That I liked, that was always too good for this world.	Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked 
0	5878	15582	That I left in the French Quarter.	Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections 
0	5879	15583	Than people who are most content.	I don't have any regrets  they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
0	5880	15584	You always said people don't do what they believe in,	They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
0	5881	15585	"And I always said, ""Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."""	There was a movie I seen one time  I think I sat through it twice,
0	5882	15586	I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,	All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
0	5883	15587	He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.	Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
0	5884	15588	Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,	Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
0	5885	15589	Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,	Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
0	5886	15590	Don't ever try to change me,	I been in this thing too long.
0	5887	15591	There's nothing you can say or do	To make me think I'm wrong.
0	5888	15592	Well, I'm going off to Libya,	There's a guy I gotta see.
0	5889	15593	He been living there three years now	In an oil refinery.
1	5890	15594	I got my mind made up,	Oh, got my mind made up.
0	5891	15595	Oh!	Call your ma in Tallahassee,
1	5892	15596	Tell her her baby's on the line.	Tell her not to worry,
0	5893	15597	Everything is gonna be fine.	Well, I gave you all my money,
0	5894	15598	All my connections too.	There ain't nothing in this world
0	5895	15599	You can say I didn't give to you.	I got my mind made up, yeah!
0	5896	15600	Got my mind made up.	You will be alright, girl,
1	5897	15601	Someone's watching over you.	He won't do nothing to you,
0	5898	15602	Baby, that I wouldn't do.	Well, if you don't want to see me,
1	5899	15603	Look athe other way.	You don't have to feed me,
0	5900	15604	I ain't your dog that's gone astray.	I got my mind made up,
1	5901	15605	I got my mind made up,	Got my mind made up,
1	5902	15606	I got my mind made up,	Got my mind made up.
0	5903	15607	Something about you that I can't shake,	Don't know how much more of this I can take.
0	5904	15608	Baby, I'm under your spell.	I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
0	5905	15609	When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.	Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
0	5906	15610	It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.	If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
0	5907	15611	Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.	I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
0	5908	15612	I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,	Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
0	5909	15613	But I will be back, I will survive,	You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
0	5910	15614	Baby, can't you tell?	Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
0	5911	15615	I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,	Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
0	5912	15616	Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,	Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
0	5913	15617	You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,	I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
0	5914	15618	Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,	Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
0	5915	15619	Baby, is there anything left to tell?	I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
0	5916	15620	Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.	Baby, what more can I tell?
0	5917	15621	Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,	Pray that I don't die of thirst,
0	5918	15622	Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,	Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
0	5919	15623	Come on, come on, stick together,	You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
0	5920	15624	Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,	Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
0	5921	15625	Come on, come on, stick together,	We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
0	5922	15626	Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,	Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
0	5923	15627	Come on, come on, let's stick together,	You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
0	5924	15628	It might be tough for a while, but consider the child	Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
0	5925	15629	Come on, come on, stick together,	You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
1	5926	15630	When did you leave heaven?	How could they let you go?
0	5927	15631	How's everything in heaven?	I'd like to know.
0	5928	15632	Why did you trade heaven	For all these earthly things?
1	5929	15633	Where did you hide your halo?	Where did you lose your wings?
1	5930	15634	Have they missed you?	Can you get back in?
0	5931	15635	If I kiss you, would it be a sin?	I am only human, but you are so divine.

0	6040	15744	I wandered again to my home in the mountain	Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
0	6041	15745	I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,	I found they were all rank strangers to me.
0	6042	15746	Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,	No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
0	6043	15747	They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,	I found they were all rank strangers to me.

0	6049	15753	Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down	All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
0	6050	15754	For there's a slow  there's a slow, slow train coming.	I had a woman down in Alabama,

0	6175	15879	We live in a political world,	Love don't have any place,
0	6176	15880	We living in times when men commit crimes	And crime don't have a face.
0	6177	15881	We live in a political world,	Icicles hanging down,
0	6178	15882	Wedding bells ring and angels sing	And clouds cover up the ground.
1	6179	15883	We live in a political world,	Wisdom is thrown into jail,
0	6180	15884	It rots in a cell misguided as hell,	Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
0	6181	15885	We live in a political world	Where mercy walks the plank,
0	6182	15886	Life is in mirrors, death disappears	Up the steps into the nearest bank.
0	6183	15887	We live in a political world,	Courage is a thing of the past,
0	6184	15888	Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,	The next day could be your last.
0	6185	15889	We live in a political world,	The one we can see and can feel,
0	6186	15890	But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,	We all know for sure that it's real.
1	6187	15891	We live in a political world,	The cities of a lonesome fear,
0	6188	15892	Little by little you turn in the middle,	But you're never sure why you're here.
0	6189	15893	We live in a political world,	Under the microscope,
0	6190	15894	You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,	You always got more than enough rope.
0	6191	15895	We live in a political world,	Turning and athrashing about,
0	6192	15896	As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take	What looks like the easy way out.
0	6193	15897	We live in a political world	Where peace is not welcome at all,
0	6194	15898	It's turned away from the door to wander some more	Or put up against the wall.
0	6195	15899	We live in a political world,	Everything's ahers or his,
0	6196	15900	Climb into the frame and shout God's name,	But you're not even sure what it is.
1	6197	15901	Far away where the soft winds blow,	Far away from it all,
1	6198	15902	There is a place you go	Where teardrops fall.
1	6199	15903	Far away in the stormy night,	Far away and over the wall,
0	6200	15904	You are there in the flickering light	Where teardrops fall.
1	6201	15905	We banged the drum slowly	And played the fife lowly,
0	6202	15906	You know the song in my heart.	In the turning of twilight,
0	6203	15907	In the shadows of moonlight,	You can show me a new place to start.
0	6204	15908	I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,	Stripping away at it all,
0	6205	15909	Thinking of you when the sun comes up	Where teardrops fall.
1	6206	15910	By rivers of blindness,	In love and with kindness,
0	6207	15911	We can hold up a toast if we meet	To the cutting of fences
0	6208	15912	To sharpen the senses	That linger in the fireball heat.
0	6209	15913	Roses are red, violets are blue,	And time is beginning to crawl.
0	6210	15914	I just might have to come see you	Where teardrops fall.
1	6211	15915	Broken lines, broken strings,	Broken threads, broken springs,
1	6212	15916	Broken idols, broken heads,	People sleeping in broken beds.
0	6213	15917	Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,	Everything is broken.
1	6214	15918	Broken bottles, broken plates,	Broken switches, broken gates,
0	6215	15919	Broken dishes, broken parts,	Streets are filled with broken hearts.
0	6216	15920	Broken words never meant to be spoken,	Everything is broken.
0	6217	15921	Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,	Something else just ahit the ground.
1	6218	15922	Broken cutters, broken saws,	Broken buckles, broken laws,
1	6219	15923	Broken bodies, broken bones,	Broken voices on broken phones.
0	6220	15924	Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,	Everything is broken.
0	6221	15925	Every time you leave and go off some place,	Things fall to pieces in my face.
1	6222	15926	Broken hands on broken plows,	Broken treaties, broken vows,
1	6223	15927	Broken pipes, broken tools,	People bending broken rules.
0	6224	15928	Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,	Everything is broken.
0	6225	15929	Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,	Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
0	6226	15930	For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side	And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
0	6227	15931	Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,	Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
0	6228	15932	Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow	And the sun is agoing down upon the sacred cow.
0	6229	15933	Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,	Ring them bells so the world will know thata God is one.
0	6230	15934	Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep	And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
1	6231	15935	Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,	Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
0	6232	15936	Ring them bells for the chosen few	Who will judge the many when the game is through,
0	6233	15937	Ring them bells for the time that flies,	For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
0	6234	15938	Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,	Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
0	6235	15939	Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong	And they're breaking down the distance between aright and wrong.
0	6236	15940	Crickets are chirping, the water is high,	There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
0	6237	15941	Her window's wide open, African trees	Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
0	6238	15942	Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,	She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
0	6239	15943	Somebody seen him hanging around	At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
0	6240	15944	He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask	If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
0	6241	15945	Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,	There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
0	6242	15946	Preacher was atalking, there's a sermon he gave,	He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
0	6243	15947	You cannot depend on it to be your guide	When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
0	6244	15948	It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,	She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
0	6245	15949	"""There are no mistakes in life,"" some people say"	And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
0	6246	15950	But people don't live or die, people just float,	She went with the man in the long, black coat.
0	6247	15951	There's smoke on the water, it's abeen there since June,	Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
0	6248	15952	Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,	Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
0	6249	15953	She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,	She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
0	6250	15954	Most of the time I'm clearfocused all around,	Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
0	6251	15955	I can follow the path, I can read the signs,	Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
0	6252	15956	I can handle whatever I stumble upon,	I don't even notice she gone
0	6253	15957	Most of the time.	Most of the time it's well understood,
0	6254	15958	Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.	I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
0	6255	15959	I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,	I can survive and I can endure
0	6256	15960	And I don't even think about her	Most of the time.
0	6257	15961	Most of the time my head is on straight,	Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
0	6258	15962	I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,	I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
0	6259	15963	I can smile in the face of mankind,	Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
0	6260	15964	Most of the time.	Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
0	6261	15965	I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,	Most of the time I can't even be sure
0	6262	15966	If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.	Most of the time I'm halfways content,
0	6263	15967	Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.	I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
0	6264	15968	Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,	I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
0	6265	15969	I don't even care if I ever see her again	Most of the time.
0	6266	15970	What good am I if I'm like all the rest,	If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
0	6267	15971	If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,	What good am I?
0	6268	15972	What good am I if I know and don't do,	If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
0	6269	15973	If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,	What good am I?
0	6270	15974	What good am I while you softly weep	And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
0	6271	15975	And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,	What good am I?
0	6272	15976	What good am I then to others and me	If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
0	6273	15977	If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within	Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
0	6274	15978	What good am I if I say foolish things	And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
0	6275	15979	And I just turn my back while you silently die,	What good am I?
1	6276	15980	There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,	Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
0	6277	15981	Come right down the highway, straight down the line,	Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,

0	6279	15983	Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,	Steps into your room, eats into your soul,

0	6292	15996	Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?	What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
0	6293	15997	Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.	Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
0	6294	15998	Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?	Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
0	6295	15999	What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.	Are you the same person that was here before?
0	6296	16000	Is it something important? Maybe not.	What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.

0	6301	16005	Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,	You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
0	6302	16006	I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.	Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
0	6303	16007	Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,	If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
0	6304	16008	Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?	Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.

0	6362	16066	One time in London I'd gone out for a walk	Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
0	6363	16067	'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,	To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
0	6364	16068	There was someone on a platform talking to the folks	About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
0	6365	16069	"""It's too bright a light,"" he said, ""for anybody's eyes,"	"If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."""
0	6366	16070	I moved in closer, got up on my toes,	Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
0	6367	16071	Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young	Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
0	6368	16072	"""The news of the day is on all the time,"	All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
0	6369	16073	Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,	"Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."""
0	6370	16074	"""Pray for peace!"" he said, you could feel it in the crowd."	My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
0	6371	16075	"""It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone."	"No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."""

0	6373	16077	It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.	"Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."""
0	6374	16078	"""It's all been designed,"" he said, ""to make you lose your mind"	And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
0	6375	16079	Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.	"If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."""
0	6376	16080	The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,	There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
0	6377	16081	TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.	Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
1	6378	16082	Ten thousand men on a hill,	Ten thousand men on a hill,

1	6398	16102	Nine by nine they drank the wine,	Ten by ten they drank it again.
1	6399	16103	How many tomorrows have they given away?	How many compared to yesterday?
1	6400	16104	How many more without any reward?	How many more can they afford?
1	6401	16105	Two by two they stepped into the ark,	Two by two they step in the dark,
0	6402	16106	Three by three they're turning the key,	Four by four they turn it some more.
0	6403	16107	One by one they follow the sun,	Two by two, to another rendezvous,
0	6404	16108	Three by three, it don't set on me,	Four by four, no illusion for,

0	6486	16190	Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.	"""Well met, well met, my own, true love."""
0	6487	16191	"""Well met, well met,"" cried she."	"""I've just returned from the salt, salt sea"
0	6488	16192	"And it's all for the love of thee."""	"""I could have married a king's daughter there,"
0	6489	16193	She would have married me,	But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
0	6490	16194	"It's all for the love of thee."""	"""Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,"
0	6491	16195	I'm sure you're the one to blame	For I am married to a house carpenter
0	6492	16196	"And I'm asure he's a fine, young man."""	"""Forsake, forsake your house carpenter"
0	6493	16197	And come away with me.	I'll take you to where the green grass grows
0	6494	16198	"On the shores of sunny Italy."""	So up she picked her babies three
0	6495	16199	And give them kisses, one, two, three,	"Saying, ""Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone"
0	6496	16200	"And keep him good company."""	Well, they were sailing about two weeks 
0	6497	16201	I'm sure it was not three 	When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
0	6498	16202	Saying wants company.	"""Well, are you weeping for your house and home"
0	6499	16203	"Or are you weeping for your babe?"""	"""Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,"
0	6500	16204	"I'm weeping for my babies three."""	"""Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?"
0	6501	16205	"They look as white as snow."""	"""Those are the hills of heaven, my love,"
0	6502	16206	"You and I'll never know."""	"""What are those hills yonder, my love?"
0	6503	16207	"They look as dark as night."""	"""Those are the hills of hellfire, my love,"
0	6504	16208	"Where you and I will unite."""	Oh, twice around went the gallant ship 
0	6505	16209	I'm sure it was not three 	When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
0	6506	16210	Well, I saw it advertised one day	That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
0	6507	16211	"""Come along and take a trip,"	We'll bring you up there on a ship.
1	6508	16212	Bring the wife and family,	"Bring the whole kids."" Yippee!"
0	6509	16213	Well, I run right down and bought a ticket	To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
0	6510	16214	Little did I realize	I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
0	6511	16215	Had nothing to do with picnic,	Didn't come close to a mountain,
0	6512	16216	I hate bears.	Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
0	6513	16217	There were six thousand people there.	Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
0	6514	16218	"""Oh, well,"" I said, ""it's a pretty big ship."	"Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."""
0	6515	16219	Well, we all got on, what do you think?	That big, old boat started to sink.
1	6516	16220	More people kept apiling on,	That old ship was agoing down.
0	6517	16221	Funny way to start a picnic.	Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
0	6518	16222	So many people I never saw in my life.	That old ship was sinking down in the water,
0	6519	16223	There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,	Dogs abarking, cats ascreaming, women ayelling,
0	6520	16224	Men aflying, fists aflying, paper flying,	Cops acoming, me arunning.
0	6521	16225	Maybe we just better call off the picnic.	I got shoved down, got pushed around,
1	6522	16226	All I remember was a moaning sound,	Don't remember one thing more.
0	6523	16227	All I remember is waking up on the shore,	My arms and legs were broken,
0	6524	16228	My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,	I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
0	6525	16229	Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.	Quite lucky to be alive, though!
0	6526	16230	Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,	I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
0	6527	16231	Took the wife and kids and started home,	Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
0	6528	16232	Now, I don't care just awhat you do,	If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
0	6529	16233	But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,	You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
0	6530	16234	Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.	Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
0	6531	16235	What some people are gonna do for money.	There's a brandnew gimmick every day
0	6532	16236	Just to take somebody's money away.	I think we oughtta take some of these people,
0	6533	16237	I will not go down under the ground	'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
0	6534	16238	And I will not carry myself down to die,	When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
0	6535	16239	Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.	There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
0	6536	16240	The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,	And some people thinking that the end is close by,
0	6537	16241	'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.	Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
0	6538	16242	I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see	When someone is pulling the wool over me,
0	6539	16243	And, if this war comes and death's all around,	Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
0	6540	16244	Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.	There's always been people that have to cause fear,
0	6541	16245	They've been talking about a war now for amany long years.	I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
0	6542	16246	But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.	Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
0	6543	16247	Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,	Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
0	6544	16248	Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,	Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
0	6545	16249	Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,	And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
0	6546	16250	See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,	Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
0	6547	16251	Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul	And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
0	6548	16252	Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell	About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
0	6549	16253	His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,	He's had twentyseven children, yet he's never had a wife.
1	6550	16254	And it's ride, Willie, ride,	Roll, Willie, roll,
0	6551	16255	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.	Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
0	6552	16256	Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.	He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
0	6553	16257	Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.	And it's ride, aWillie, ride,
0	6554	16258	Roll, Willie, roll,	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.
0	6555	16259	Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,	They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
0	6556	16260	"""I've come to win some money,"" Gambling Willie says."	When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
1	6557	16261	And it's ride, Willie, ride,	Roll, Willie, roll,
0	6558	16262	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.	Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
0	6559	16263	There was an allnight poker game, lasted about a week.	Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
0	6560	16264	When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.	And it's ride, Willie, ride,
0	6561	16265	Roll, Willie, roll,	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.
0	6562	16266	But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,	He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
0	6563	16267	He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,	He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
1	6564	16268	And it's ride, Willie, ride,	Roll, Willie, roll,
0	6565	16269	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.	When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
0	6566	16270	Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.	He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
0	6567	16271	The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.	And it's ride, Willie, ride,
0	6568	16272	Roll, Willie, roll,	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.
0	6569	16273	It was late one evening during a poker game,	A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
0	6570	16274	He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,	Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
1	6571	16275	And it's ride, Willie, ride,	Roll, Willie, roll,
0	6572	16276	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.	So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
0	6573	16277	The moral of the story is very plain to see:	Make your money while you can before you have to stop
0	6574	16278	For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.	And it's ride, Willie, ride,
0	6575	16279	Roll, Willie, roll,	Wherever you're agambling now nobody knows.
0	6576	16280	Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.	Hava
1	6577	16281	Havana	Havanagee

0	6589	16293	Well, if you can't quit your sinning,	Please quit your lowdown ways.
0	6590	16294	And you can hitchhike on the highway,	You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
0	6591	16295	Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,	But you ain't agonna ride in my car no more,
0	6592	16296	You're gonna need  you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.	Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
0	6593	16297	Please quit your lowdown ways.	So you can read out your hymnbook,
0	6594	16298	You can fall down on your knees	And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
0	6595	16299	But it ain't gonna do no good,	You're gonna need  you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
0	6596	16300	If you can't quit your sinning,	Please quit your lowdown ways.
1	6597	16301	I got those worried blues,	And I got those worried blues,
1	6598	16302	I got those worried blues,	I got those worried blues,
0	6599	16303	Lord, I'm agoing where I never been before.	I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
1	6600	16304	I'm agoing where the chilly winds don't blow,	I'm agoing where the chilly winds don't blow,
1	6601	16305	I'm agoing where the chilly winds don't blow,	I'm agoing where the climate suits my clothes.
1	6602	16306	Honey baby, don't leave me now,	Honey baby, don't leave me now,
1	6603	16307	Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,	Honey baby, don't leave me now,

1	6607	16311	So I got those worries blues,	Lord, I got the worried blues,
1	6608	16312	I got the worried blues,	And I got the worried blues,
0	6609	16313	The winter wind is ablowing strong, my hands agot no gloves,	I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm athinking of.
0	6610	16314	Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,	You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
0	6611	16315	High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,	All because I'm falling for a curlyheaded, darkeyed gal.
0	6612	16316	Who's agonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandycolored skin?	Who's agonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
0	6613	16317	When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?	Who's agonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
0	6614	16318	Who's agonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?	Who's agonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
0	6615	16319	Who's agonna walk you side by side? Who's agonna be your man?	Who's agonna look you straight in the eye and hold your badluck hand?
0	6616	16320	Hold your badluck hand, babe, hold your badluck hand,	Who's agonna hold your hardluck hand and who's agonna be your man?
0	6617	16321	The winter wind is ablowing strong, my hands agot no gloves,	I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm athinking of.
0	6618	16322	Alord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,	And I'm walking down the line  my feet'll be flying  to tell about my troubled mind.
1	6619	16323	I got a heavyheaded gal, I got a heavyheaded gal,	I got a heavyheaded gal, she ain't afeeling well,
0	6620	16324	When she's better only time'll tell.	Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
0	6621	16325	And I'm walking down the line  my feet'll be flying  to tell about my troubled mind.	My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
0	6622	16326	My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows	Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
0	6623	16327	Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,	Lord, I'm walking down the line  my feet'll be flying  to tell about my troubled mind.
0	6624	16328	I see the morning light, I see the morning light,	Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
0	6625	16329	I didn't go to sleep last night.	Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
0	6626	16330	Lord, I'm walking down the line  my feet'll be flying  to tell about my troubled mind.	I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
0	6627	16331	I got my walking shoes and I ain't agonna lose,	What else can a poor boy do?
0	6628	16332	Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,	Lord, I'm walking down the line  my feet'll be aflying  to tell about my troubled mind.
0	6629	16333	Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,	No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
0	6630	16334	Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,	All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
0	6631	16335	From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,	Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
0	6632	16336	And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,	All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
0	6633	16337	Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,	Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
0	6634	16338	And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,	All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6635	16339	Oh, it's faretheewell to the deep, hollow dungeon,	Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
0	6636	16340	Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,	All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6637	16341	It's many a guard that stands around smiling,	Holding his club like he was a king,
0	6638	16342	Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,	All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6639	16343	The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows	And the wind punched hard to make the wallsiding sing,
0	6640	16344	It's many a night I pretended to be asleeping,	All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6641	16345	As the rain rattled heavy on the bunkhouse shingles	And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
0	6642	16346	Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,	All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6643	16347	Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,	And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
0	6644	16348	And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads	From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
0	6645	16349	The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,	But the good road is awaiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
0	6646	16350	Trails of troubles, roads of battles,	Paths of victory we shall walk.
0	6647	16351	I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,	I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
0	6648	16352	Trails of troubles, toads of battles,	Paths of victory we shall walk.
0	6649	16353	The evening dust was rolling, I's awalking down the track,	There was a oneway wind ablowing, it was blowing at my back.
0	6650	16354	Trails of troubles, roads of battles,	Paths of victory we shall walk.
0	6651	16355	The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,	But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
0	6652	16356	Trails of troubles, roads of battles,	Paths of victory we shall walk.
0	6653	16357	The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels	Told me of a new day coming across the field.
0	6654	16358	Trails of troubles, roads of battles,	Paths of victory we shall walk.
0	6655	16359	"This is called ""Talking John Birch Blues"" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!"	Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
0	6656	16360	I didn't know what I was agonna do.	The Communists was acoming around,
0	6657	16361	They was in the air, they was on the ground,	They was all over!
0	6658	16362	So I run down most hurriedly	And joined the John Birch Society,
0	6659	16363	Got me a secret membership card,	Went back home to the yard,
0	6660	16364	Starting look on the sidewalk,	Under the hedges.
0	6661	16365	Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,	I was looking every place for them goddarned Reds,
0	6662	16366	Looked behind the sink and under the floor,	Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
0	6663	16367	I couldn't find any.	Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
0	6664	16368	Looking for them Reds everywhere.	Looked up my chimneyhole,
0	6665	16369	Even deep down inside my toiletbowl.	They got away!
0	6666	16370	I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,	So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
0	6667	16371	Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,	"Saying, ""Hands up, you Communists!"""
1	6668	16372	It was the mailman!	He punched me out!
0	6669	16373	Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,	I figured they was in my TV set!
0	6670	16374	I peeked behind the picture frame,	Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
1	6671	16375	Them Reds did it!	Hootenanny television!
0	6672	16376	Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,	Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
0	6673	16377	Followed some clues from my detective bag,	I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
0	6674	16378	Betty Ross!	Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
0	6675	16379	Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.	To my knowledge there's just one man
0	6676	16380	That's really and truly an American.	That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
0	6677	16381	I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.	Well, I finally started thinking straight
0	6678	16382	When I run outta things to investigate.	Couldn't imagine nothing else,
0	6679	16383	So now I'm home investigating myself!	Hope I don't find out too much!
0	6680	16384	Who killed Davey Moore?	Why and what's the reason for?
0	6681	16385	"""Not I,"" said the referee,"	"""Don't point your finger at me."
0	6682	16386	I coulda stopped it in the eighth	And maybe kept him from his fate,
0	6683	16387	But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,	At not getting their money's worth.
0	6684	16388	It's too bad he had to go,	But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
1	6685	16389	It wasn't me that made him fall,	"You can't blame me at all."""
0	6686	16390	Who killed Davey Moore?	Why and what's the reason for?
0	6687	16391	"""Not us,"" said the angry crowd,"	Whose screams filled the arena loud,
0	6688	16392	"""It's too bad he had to die that night,"	We just like to see a good, oldfashioned fight.
0	6689	16393	We didn't mean for him to meet his death,	We just wanted to see some sweat 
0	6690	16394	There ain't nothing wrong in that.	It wasn't us that made him fall,

0	6712	16416	As I was out walking on the corner one day,	I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
0	6713	16417	His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor	And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
0	6714	16418	Only a hobo, but one more is gone,	Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
0	6715	16419	Leaving nobody to carry him home,	He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
0	6716	16420	A blanket of newspaper covered his head,	As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
0	6717	16421	One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come	And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
0	6718	16422	He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,	Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
0	6719	16423	Leaving nobody to carry him home,	He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
0	6720	16424	Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,	To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
0	6721	16425	To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,	To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
0	6722	16426	He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,	Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
0	6723	16427	Leaving nobody to carry him home,	He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
0	6724	16428	I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,	I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
0	6725	16429	I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still	And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
0	6726	16430	I'll go to some barroom and drink with my friends,	Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
0	6727	16431	God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,	Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
0	6728	16432	Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,	A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
0	6729	16433	The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:	When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
0	6730	16434	Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop	And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
0	6731	16435	Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	6732	16436	And the sea will split and the ships will hit	And the shoreline sands will be shaking
0	6733	16437	And the tide will sound and the waves will pound	And the morning will be breaking.
0	6734	16438	Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path	And the seagulls, they'll be asmiling
0	6735	16439	And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	6736	16440	And the words that are used for to get the ship confused	Will not be understood as they're spoken
0	6737	16441	For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night	And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
0	6738	16442	A song will lift as the mainsail shifts	And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
0	6739	16443	And the sun will respect every face on the deck,	The hour that the ship comes in.
0	6740	16444	And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold	For your weary toes to be atouching
0	6741	16445	And the ship's wise men will remind you once again	That the whole, wide world is watching.
0	6742	16446	Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes	And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
0	6743	16447	But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,	The hour when the ship comes in.
0	6744	16448	"And they'll raise their hands, saying, ""We'll meet all your demands"","	"But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered!"""

0	6747	16451	And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,	And, if breath to you is worth saving,
0	6748	16452	Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone	For the times, they are achanging.
0	6749	16453	Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,	And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again,
0	6750	16454	And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin	And there's no telling who that it's naming
0	6751	16455	For the loser now will be later to win	'Cause the times, they are achanging.
0	6752	16456	Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,	Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
0	6753	16457	For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled	'Cause the battle outside raging
0	6754	16458	Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls	For the times, they are achanging.
0	6755	16459	Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,	And don't criticize what you can't understand.
0	6756	16460	Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,	Your old road's rapidly aging.
0	6757	16461	Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand	'Cause the times, they are achanging.
0	6758	16462	The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,	The slowest now will later be fast
0	6759	16463	As the present now will later be past.	The order is rapidly fading
0	6760	16464	And the first one now will later be last	'Cause the times, they are achanging.
0	6761	16465	"There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, ""What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?""

Ha, but, but, uh, I'dI'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called ""Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie""."	Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
0	6762	16466	When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,	When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
0	6763	16467	In the slowmotion crawl or life's busy race,	No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
0	6764	16468	If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,	If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
0	6765	16469	And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,	And your trainengine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
0	6766	16470	And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,	And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
0	6767	16471	And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,	And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
0	6768	16472	And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,	And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
0	6769	16473	And your rope is asliding 'cause your hands are dripping,	And your sundecked desert and evergreen valleys
0	6770	16474	Turn to brokendown slums and trashcan alleys,	And your sky cries water and your drainpipe's apouring,
0	6771	16475	And the lightning's aflashing and the thunder's acrashing,	And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
0	6772	16476	And your whole world's aslamming and banging,	And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
0	6773	16477	And to yourself you sometimes say,	"""I never knew it was gonna be this way."
0	6774	16478	"Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"""	And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
0	6775	16479	And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,	And you're kneedeep in dark water with your hands in the air,
0	6776	16480	"And the whole world's watching with the ""windowpeek"" stare,"	And your good gal leaves and she's long gone aflying,
0	6777	16481	And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,	And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet 
0	6778	16482	But you need it badly and it lays on the street,	And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
0	6779	16483	And you think your ears mighta been hurt	Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sightblinding dirt,
0	6780	16484	And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush	When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
0	6781	16485	And all the time you're holding the three queens,	It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
0	6782	16486	Like in the middle of Life magazine,	Bouncing around a pinball machine,
0	6783	16487	And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,	That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
0	6784	16488	But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head	And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
0	6785	16489	And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,	And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
0	6786	16490	And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,	And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
0	6787	16491	And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,	And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
0	6788	16492	And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,	And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
0	6789	16493	"You say to yourself, ""Just what am I doing"	On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
0	6790	16494	On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,	In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
0	6791	16495	Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?	Why am I walking? Where am I running?
0	6792	16496	What am I saying? What am I knowing	On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
0	6793	16497	On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,	In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
0	6794	16498	In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?	Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
0	6795	16499	"What am I giving? What am I taking?"""	But you try with your whole soul,
0	6796	16500	Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,	Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
0	6797	16501	Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down	'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
0	6798	16502	And you fear they might catch you sleeping,	And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
0	6799	16503	And you can'tyou remember for the best of your thinking	If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
0	6800	16504	And you know that it's something special you're needing,	You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
0	6801	16505	And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,	Need something specialneed something special, alright,
0	6802	16506	You need a fastflying train on a tornado track,	To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
0	6803	16507	You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler	That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
0	6804	16508	That knows your troubles a hundred times over,	You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
0	6805	16509	That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,	And, by any number of bets in the book,
0	6806	16510	Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze,	You need something to open up a new door,
0	6807	16511	To show you something you seen before	But overlooked a hundred times or more,
1	6808	16512	You need something to open your eyes,	You need something to make it known
0	6809	16513	That it's you and no one else that owns	That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
0	6810	16514	That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,	It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
0	6811	16515	You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,	But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
0	6812	16516	On some windy corner 'round a wideangled curve,	But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
0	6813	16517	And your trouble is you know it too good	'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
0	6814	16518	'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,	And it ain't on Macy's windowsill,
0	6815	16519	And it ain't on a real rich kid's roadmap,	And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
0	6816	16520	And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,	And it ain't on that dimlit stage
0	6817	16521	With that halfwit comedian on it,	Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
0	6818	16522	No, you can't find it neither in no nightclub, no yacht club,	And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
0	6819	16523	And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell	That, no matter how hard you rub,
0	6820	16524	You just ain't agonna find it on your ticket stub,	No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
0	6821	16525	And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,	It ain't in the cardboardbox house,
0	6822	16526	Or down any movie star's blouse,	And you can't find it on the golf course,
0	6823	16527	And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,	And it ain't in the creampuff hairdo or cottoncandy clothes,
0	6824	16528	Ain't in the dimestore dummies and bubblegum goons,	And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolatecake voices
0	6825	16529	That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,	"Saying, ""Ain't I pretty?"" and, ""Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,"
1	6826	16530	Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,	"Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"""
0	6827	16531	When you can't even sense has it got any insides?	These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
0	6828	16532	No, you'll not now or no other day	Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
0	6829	16533	And inside it with the people made of molasses	That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
0	6830	16534	And it ain't in the fiftystar generals and flippedout phonies,	Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
0	6831	16535	Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,	And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
0	6832	16536	But this time behind your back, my friend,	The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
0	6833	16537	And play games with each other in their sandbox world,	And you can't find it either in the notalent fools
0	6834	16538	That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,	And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
0	6835	16539	And think they're fooling you,	The ones that jump on the wagon
0	6836	16540	Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style	To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
0	6837	16541	And make all kinds of money and chicks,	And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
0	6838	16542	"Saying, ""Christ, do I gotta be like that?"	Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
0	6839	16543	Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?	"Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."""
0	6840	16544	No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,	Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
0	6841	16545	You gotta look some other place,	And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
1	6842	16546	Where do you look for this lamp that's aburning,	Where do you look for this oilwell gushing,
0	6843	16547	Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,	Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
0	6844	16548	And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,	Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
0	6845	16549	Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,	You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
0	6846	16550	You can either go to the church of your choice,	Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
0	6847	16551	You find God in the church of your choice,	You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
0	6848	16552	And, though it's only my opinion  I may be right or wrong,	You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
0	6849	16553	Old Reilly stole a stallion,	But they caught him and they brought him back
0	6850	16554	And they laid him down in the jailhouse ground	With an iron chain around his neck.
0	6851	16555	When Reilly's daughter got a message	That her father was going to hang,
0	6852	16556	She rode by night and came by morning	With gold and silver in her hand.
0	6853	16557	When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,	His old eyes deepened in his head,
0	6854	16558	"Saying, ""Gold will never free your father,"	"The price, my dear, is you instead."""
0	6855	16559	"""Oh, I'm as good as dead!"" cried Reilly."	"""It's only you that he does crave"
0	6856	16560	And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,	"Get on your horse and ride away."""
0	6857	16561	"""Oh, father, you will surely die"	If I don't take the chance to try
0	6858	16562	And pay the price and not take your advice,	"For that reason I will have to stay."""
0	6859	16563	The gallows' shadows shook the evening,	In the night a hound dog bayed,
1	6860	16564	In the night the grounds was groaning,	In the night the price was paid.
0	6861	16565	The next morning she had awoken	To find that the judge had never spoken.
0	6862	16566	She saw that hanging branch abending,	She saw her father's body broken.
0	6863	16567	These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,	That one doctor cannot save him,
1	6864	16568	That two healers cannot heal him,	And that three eyes cannot see him,
1	6865	16569	That four ears cannot hear him,	That five walls cannot hide him,
0	6866	16570	That six diggers cannot bury him,	And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
0	6867	16571	I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,	She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
0	6868	16572	She called with her eyes to the tune I's aplaying,	But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
0	6869	16573	Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting	The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
0	6870	16574	With a longdistance look her eyes was on fire,	But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
0	6871	16575	My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,	With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
0	6872	16576	As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,	But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
0	6873	16577	I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending	That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
0	6874	16578	As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,	But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
0	6875	16579	As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar	And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
0	6876	16580	But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,	So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
0	6877	16581	Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat	And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
0	6878	16582	Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,	But, mama, you been on my mind.
0	6879	16583	I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,	"I am not pleading or saying ""I can't forget you"","
0	6880	16584	I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,	Mama, you been on my mind.
0	6881	16585	Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,	Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
0	6882	16586	I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,	Mama, you're just on my mind.
0	6883	16587	"I'm not asking you to say words like ""yes"" or ""no"","	Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
0	6884	16588	I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,	Mama, you are on my mind.
0	6885	16589	When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,	You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
0	6886	16590	I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear	As someone who has had you on his mind.
0	6887	16591	Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown	Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
0	6888	16592	The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,	But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
0	6889	16593	There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,	There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
0	6890	16594	The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,	But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
0	6891	16595	The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,	Fiftytwo gypsies now file past the guard
0	6892	16596	In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,	Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
0	6893	16597	See the crosseyed pirates sit perched in the sun,	Shooting tin cans with a sawedoff shotgun,
0	6894	16598	And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,	But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
0	6895	16599	King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance	Valentinotype tangos while the heroes clean hands.
0	6896	16600	Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,	Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
0	6897	16601	The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear	When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
0	6898	16602	What cannot be imitated perfect must die,	Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
0	6899	16603	Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks	At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
0	6900	16604	Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,	But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
1	6901	16605	Johnny's in the basement	Mixing up the medicine,
1	6902	16606	I'm on the pavement	Looking 'bout the government,
0	6903	16607	The man in the trenchcoat,	Badge out, laid off,
1	6904	16608	Says he's got a bad bill,	Wants to get it paid off.
1	6905	16609	Look out, kid,	It's something you did
1	6906	16610	God knows when,	But you're doing it again,
0	6907	16611	You better duck down the alleyway,	Looking for a new friend.
1	6908	16612	Man in the coonskin cap	In the pigpen
1	6909	16613	Wants eleven dollar bills	And you only got ten.
1	6910	16614	Maggie comes fleetfoot,	Face full of black soot,
1	6911	16615	Talking that the heat put	Plants in the bed, but
1	6912	16616	The phone's tapped anyway,	Maggie says that many say
0	6913	16617	They must bust in early May,	Orders from the D.A.
0	6914	16618	Look out, kid,	It don't matter what you did,
1	6915	16619	Don't walk on your tiptoes,	Don't tie no bows,
0	6916	16620	Better stay away from those	That carry 'round a firehose,
1	6917	16621	Keep a clean nose,	Be careful of the clean clothes,
0	6918	16622	You don't need a weatherman	To know which way the wind blows.
1	6919	16623	Well, get sick, get well,	Hang around the inkwell,
1	6920	16624	Ring bar, hard to tell	If anything is gonna sell,
1	6921	16625	Try hard, get barred,	Get back, write Braille,
1	6922	16626	Get jailed, jump bail,	Join the army if you fail.
1	6923	16627	Look out, kid,	You're gonna get hit
1	6924	16628	By users, cheaters,	Sixtime losers
1	6925	16629	Hanging 'round the theaters,	A girl by the whirlpool
1	6926	16630	Is looking for a new fool,	Don't follow leaders
0	6927	16631	And watch the parking meters.	Get born, keep warm,
0	6928	16632	Short pants, romance, learn to dance,	Get dressed, get blessed,
0	6929	16633	Try to be a success,	Please her, please him, buy gifts,
0	6930	16634	Don't steal, don't lift,	Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
1	6931	16635	Look out, kid,	They keep it all hid,
1	6932	16636	Better jump down the manhole,	Light yourself a candle,
1	6933	16637	Don't wear sandals,	Try to avoid the scandals.
1	6934	16638	If you don't wanna be a bum,	You better not chew gum
0	6935	16639	Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,	I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
0	6936	16640	But, if you gotta go, it's alright,	But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
0	6937	16641	It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,	It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
0	6938	16642	So, if you gotta go, it's alright,	But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
0	6939	16643	I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,	But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
0	6940	16644	So, if you got to go, it's alright,	But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
0	6941	16645	It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,	It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
0	6942	16646	So, if you got to go, it's alright,	But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
0	6943	16647	I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventytwo cents,	I paid one thousand two hundred twentyseven dollars and fiftyfive cents,
0	6944	16648	See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbedwire fence,	Alright!
1	6945	16649	Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,	Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
0	6946	16650	Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,	But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
1	6947	16651	Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,	Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
0	6948	16652	She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twentyfive!	Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
0	6949	16653	I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff	Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixtynine, seventy feet over a barbedwire fence,
0	6950	16654	Once upon a time you dressed so fine,	You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
0	6951	16655	"People'd call, say, ""Beware, doll,"	"You're bound to fall."" You thought they're all kidding you."
0	6952	16656	You used to laughmake fun about	Everybody that was hanging out.
1	6953	16657	Now you don't talk so loud,	Now you don't seem so proud
0	6954	16658	About having to scrounge your next meal.	And how does it feel?
1	6955	16659	Ahow does it feel	To be out on your own,
1	6956	16660	So unknown,	Like a rolling stone?
0	6957	16661	Well, I ride on a mailtrain, baby, can't buy no thrill.	Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
0	6958	16662	Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill	And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
0	6959	16663	Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?	Don't the ghostchild look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
0	6960	16664	Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?	Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
0	6961	16665	Alright!	Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
0	6962	16666	I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.	Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
0	6963	16667	I can't help it much if this train gets lost.	Alright!
0	6964	16668	Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,	But, if I can save you any time,
0	6965	16669	Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.	Well, our train leaves at ahalf past ten,
0	6966	16670	But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.	The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
0	6967	16671	But, if I can save you any time,	Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
0	6968	16672	I can't help it if you might think that it's odd	If I say I'm loving you not for you'rewhat you are but what you're not.
0	6969	16673	Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,	But, if I will save you the time,
0	6970	16674	Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.	The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
0	6971	16675	Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,	Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
0	6972	16676	Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?	Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
0	6973	16677	Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.	Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
0	6974	16678	That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?	Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
0	6975	16679	I'd do it, but II just can't remember how.	You talk to her, she's your lover now.
0	6976	16680	Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,	But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
0	6977	16681	Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?	You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
0	6978	16682	You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,	You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
0	6979	16683	Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?	Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
0	6980	16684	I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.	With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
0	6981	16685	Must everybody bow?	You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
0	6982	16686	Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castlestairs,	But I'm not up in the castle, ahoney.
0	6983	16687	It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,	I can't even remember El Paso, ahoney.
0	6984	16688	Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.	Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
0	6985	16689	Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?	And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
0	6986	16690	She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fishhead and a harpoon	And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
0	6987	16691	You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.	Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
0	6988	16692	Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?	My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
0	6989	16693	But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.	Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
0	6990	16694	Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.	Now your mouth cries wolf while your
0	6991	16695	They say everything can be replaced,	Yet every distance is not near,
0	6992	16696	So I remember every face	Of every man who put me here.
0	6993	16697	I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
1	6994	16698	They say every man needs protection,	They say every man must fall,
0	6995	16699	Yet I swear I see my reflection	Some place so high above this wall.
0	6996	16700	I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
0	6997	16701	Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd	A man who swears he's not to blame.
0	6998	16702	All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,	Crying out that he was framed.
0	6999	16703	I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,	Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
